My husband and I are Real Club Members and have been to the Hyatt Zilara Cancun many times, first as the Royal Cancun then more recently as the Hyatt. We have, however, never travelled during a pandemic and are understandably a little nervous. I guess my first question would be ""Are the staff at the resort all vaccinated?"" Are the Covid protocols strictly enforced? Do you need to wear a mask when walking through the lobby or when entering restaurants? I'm assuming you don't need masks when you are outdoors? Also, what is your capacity like at this time of year during the pandemic? Thanks. Susan Jang"
