48,Bellagio Las Vegas,walnutdude,"Walnut, California",Jun 2017,1,,"Hey SoCalDad300, I had a similar experience during my stay at the Bellagio. Our room was also very dated and hairs other than mine were in different areas of the bathroom, toilet, floor and shower. And as you we experienced the same poor water pressure, but also had luke warm water, and corroded shower head. I as well have stayed at the Palazzo and Delano, which were both superior room not only in cleanliness but style and square footage as well. The other thing that bothered me was the fact of expecting $150 -$200 per hand and 4 hour minimum play in order to receive food comps. we had the room comped thru M-Life but was not informed of this expectation prior to completing our reservation and only found out when inquiring at the end of our stay. If knew that to be the expectation I would have gone to the Palazzo were our slot host gladly comps us rooms for much less play. I was very embarrassed when the host turned her nose up to me when i inquired. non the less i will not be returning to the Bellagio, but rather will give my business to other hotels that reward me for giving them my business."

I was notified by your security (Eric Delgado) that nothing would be done to correct the damage done to my car because there was no proof of damage and that your hotel does not assume Liability for any damages that might occur while on your property. A broken door handle should be proof enough. As a sales manager myself am very disappointed in the way my case was handled!

I see so many room negatively. we always has suites and they were perfectly maintained. This makes me wonder if this is the right club any longer. Caesar rewards are not really rewards anymore, I wondered if this is a good thing . Normally we come out 2x per year.. but with the pandemic only made it out there once in 2020 and once 2021 naturally we are from far out of state and now cannot probably be reinstated our diamond plus. It sure would be nice to be able to carry over the few points we did earn in June of 2021 You know there aren't any real rewards to being a diamond plus anymore other than The resort fee. Also we lost their beautiful diamond lounge we used for over 10 yrs.Really that is why I played so hard Each day seriously when you're spending thousands of dollars I don't think asking too much to look at this. And honestly there are other clubs that would welcome our diamond plus data right now but we are very partial to Caesars and we love staying at our Paris. I look forward to an answer from management because we never get one when we go online and look. Thank you or anyone that has an opinion on this Or who we could contact. Regards and Happy Holidays"

Unfortunately we won’t have enough guests to block 15 rooms or more to block) My question is I am a single Mom with 2 younger teenager boys 14 and 16. They do not want to share a room with their Mom. So I will need to get two rooms. How hard will it be for me to get adjoining rooms? Since I can’t block off 15 plus rooms. It is cheaper for me to book our flight and hotel through Expedia ($266/pp) then if I were to book separate. I know I could probably get adjoining rooms if I booked hotel directly. But costs more. Please no negative comments if I can’t afford it, maybe I shouldn’t go. This is very important for my oldest to have his Mom and brothers there. I will do everything I can to be there.

I have read a few comments that have stated that when people have used their timeshare points to stay at Polo Towers, they are expected to sit through yet another sales pitch. If they don’t go through the sales pitch, they are charged money on their credit cards. I have also repeatedly read that the “concierge” and other staff are very aggressive with sales attempts —- AND that they repeatedly call your room, even in the early morning, trying to sell to you.

2506,Rio All-Suite Las Vegas Hotel & Casino,Randi K,"Everett, United States",Aug 2017,38,10,"If you ever go back, I have a couple of helpful hacks for you. 1) Uber from the airport - super cheap and less waiting. 2) Don't pay to check in early, check your bags and go have fun...you have to wait in line either way 3) Coffee is 3 dollars at the bar and free refills. I never use the starbucks and the bartenders are really nice. 4) Always stop at the Smiths prior to arrival to get the little things you want to snack on, waters, etc etc. It's less to buy a bottle of wine at Smiths and refill your glass in the evening than it is to buy two glasses of wine at the Rio. 5) you can self check out from your TV in the room and just leave the room keys on the table-super easy to do in a few clicks. 6) don't believe them when they say they want to make it right...they do not. The management and powers that be have been taking this resort down little by little throughout the years disguising it as ""saving money"" when what they are doing is driving people away by making it ""just another Vegas casino"". GREAT food option is to Uber to the Blue Berry Hill Family Restaurant just up Flamingo. It's not really walking are/distance but I'm sure its about a mile up the street is all. You can pay for the Uber, the meal, desert, and still come out ahead! Hope that helps!"

Las Vegas Blvd (""The Strip"") doesn't actuallly allow for a straight view down the Strip regardless of which room you're in and which floor you're on.

I wanted to ask you how you got a hold of the tickets for the show and mainly the free stay at the Plaza. I called in for the promotion which I heard on the radio station 105.3 about an hour ago and won the package by answering a simple trivia question. The package sounds similar to your stay- 3 days and two nights with lodging and service paid for, but the gentleman said there is a $199 deposit which I will get refunded in cash to me when I check in to the plaza. Just doing research to see if this is a scam or the real deal because if this is how you got your stay there then I too want to experience and tell the world how great a trip to Vegas is. Let me know if any of you have successfully experienced the package or have been scammed etc. Thank you so much !!"

I have pictures that I haven't posted, but now that I have been charged for a fee rather than even saying we were sorry that you couldn't get into one of your rooms right away...I feel very frustrated. I feel that the service wasn't that good. We had other issues, and the front desk didn't seem to care when we told them about the issues. My friends didn't even want to take the tour. They were potential timeshare buyers, but were disappointed in the way we were treated, and the issues we had with the room. I brought three different friends who were interested. That's a shame."

5550,Golden Gate Hotel & Casino,travelgirl1960,"Saint Cloud, Minnesota",Sep 2017,135,187,"Please advise your guests about the policies for booking 3rd party reservations. Someone who works with Marriott is complaining about customer service and the lack of refunding a room they'd checked into (first night + resort fee). Clearly, the refund is not in order but a kind gesture if all agree. By the way, that will take awhile. It is beneficial to check out your accommodations, reviews, pictures, location, etc., completely before booking. Know where your room is located. Call the hotel to make special requests prior to arriving. It's all smart traveling sense. The Marriott is a chain, and the oldest hotel in Vegas, Golden Gate 1906 is still the Golden Gate many of us cherish and love for its charm."

I made a reservation through Booking-com and might need to cancel it. I booked it under free cancellation policy, but when I found out I was precharged, then I check my booking info. There indeed mentioned a precharge will be made; however, it says nothing about full refund of the early cancellation. (I still have more than 50 days before my free cancellation) I was worried. I researched the free cancellation of booking -com and then found out many people have huge problems with the policy, and some didn't get a refund even they did cancel in early days. I want to contact the hotel directly, but just couldn't find any info about email direction. I don't want to call them not just it costs a lot, but also there will be no proof on the phone. I am not saying anything bad about this hotel, but I am super worried about the refund policy. since I didn't see any. Anyone can help with email details? Thank you !!"

I always check when I go into a hotel any way and everything was fine but because of the half cleanings I had to check again and be sure. Everything was fine but they need to tighten up on the cleaning crews so that they aren't questioned or loose business. That's what I was saying, sorry for any misunderstanding. Trust, had we encountered any bed bugs you, they, and whoever else needed to know would have known clearly by the time I finished. Thank God all was well."

7211,Homewood Suites by Hilton Las Vegas Airport,beach2maitai2sunset,Washington,Feb 2019,33,4,Hi I was wondering if you can walk from Homewood Suites to the car rental center? Just wanting to know if there is a safe sidewalk across the overpass? I looked at the satellite on google maps but as I zoomed in it made it harder to tell if one could really safely walk the whole way which looks like it might be what about 1/3-1/2 mile. We have a car rental reserved for the 29th of March but we might come in on the 28th in the evening and so we would just do the hotel shuttle from the airport to the hotel. But then next day on the 29th we would need to get our car rental. We just want to make sure it would be a safe walk.
