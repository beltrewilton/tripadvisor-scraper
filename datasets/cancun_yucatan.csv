Hyatt Zilara Cancun,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",June 2021,5,Amazing experience -5 star food and service,"This was our first all inclusive resort and it was amazing. The staff , starting with Manuel were extremely courteous and helpful. Sparkling wine was brought to us on check in. A welcome greeting after a long hot day of traveling. Our ocean view rooms had views from the front and back. The hotel staff came in twice daily for cleaning and turn down. Food was incredible all around. Maria Marie the gourmet Mexican restaurant is not to be missed. Diego was incredibly attentive as was our waiter the first evening there. Camilo, the hibachi chef at Asiana was extremely talented and the food was cooked to perfection. Highly recommend."

Hyatt Zilara Cancun,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",July 2022,5,Rose petals on bed,"Resort was exactly what we needed and asked for. We stayed at the Ocean front room with a wrap around balcony. We had an unobstructed view of the ocean where we could watch the sunrise with a morning coffee. Room was equipped with a jacuzzi and a ""him & hers"" shower! We mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary and our housekeeper left rose petals on our bed along with campaign/chocolates which was very sweet and thoughtful. Super friendly staff in general. Good quality food generally. Would highly recommend Marie Maria for dinner (don't forget to get your Souffle!). Spice (buffet) also has great selections. Facilities were clean and well cared for. We stayed active during our trip and used the gym quite a bit. The gym has good view and has an outdoor pool where you can"
Hyatt Zilara Cancun,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",June 2022,5,Fantastic time,The staff at the hotel were splendid. The food was amazing. We had a very nice experience staying here for 7 days. The entertainment team were a fun group of people especially Sari and Brian. Thanks to both of them for engaging and making our stay exciting. The food was was delicious and we were very happy with the options provided by the resort. The drinks made by the poolside bars were subpar and we found ourselves not really wanting to drink crappy mixed drinks. What we did find out was the Cantina de Adelina was the perfect place to pregame for the night . Ivan was our bartender for most of the nights we stayed and he was amazing at his craft. Hospitality was super helpful and special shout out to Anna for all the wonderful recommendations. Overall the stay was better than

The food and drinks were some of the best that I have had at any all inclusive. My only complaint is the beds. My husband and I had a hard time sleeping and had sore backs all week.
Hyatt Zilara Cancun,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",July 2022,5,Amazing Experience!,"From the moment you walk into the large open lobby, beautiful views everywhere! Every single member of the staff was so nice and helpful! The ocean view suites - totally worth it.

We will definitely be back next year. Thank you for such an amazing experience!"

The location and resort is amazing, but the real game changer is the staff. They are consistently awesome throughout the resort. My wife and I went as a long weekend get away. We immediately regretted not planning for a longer stay. We cannot wait to go back. A special shout out to Elizabeth and Beatrice at the Spa - an excellent deep tissue massage! Also Reyes with drink suggestions on the beach, that man is a legend (yes, they bring cocktails right to your cabana on the beach - all included)!"

Hyatt Zilara Cancun,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",June 2022,2,Do not book here.,"I‚Äôve been to Cancun over a dozen times. We go at least once or twice a year trying all the popular resorts. We really had high hopes for this one considering the price you pay, it had to be on par with the higher up resorts. Beginning with the food, complete let down. We tried all the restaurants and even did their chef‚Äôs plate tasting. Biggest waste of $80 for 4 of us. Not a single one of us enjoyed even one of the dishes. The flavors were underwhelming, unbalanced, and uninspiring. Service was terrible in most places, for example, when going to the swim Up bar. Bartenders would take forever to assist you and even when they did, they did with disdain. Every time I wanted to order a drink I had to flag down a bartender‚Äôs attention. Service by the pool was awful too because they"

Hyatt Zilara Cancun,Utah,June 2022,5,Our Seventh Time,There is no better place for us to spend our Anniversary than at the Hyatt Zilara. Our experiences there have always been EXCELLENT and WONDERFUL! The facility is definitely a 5 STAR Resort. The staff is very respectful and only want you to be happy. When we first arrived we were greeted by the Bell Boy staff including David John who took good care of our luggage and made sure it was in our room as soon as the room was ready. He also took care of them when we checked out on our last day. We would like to recognize the staff that have been significant during our last visit. Starting with Ingrid and Evelin who are members of the concierge staff. They checked in with us each day to see if there was any way to make our vacation perfect. We thank them for helping us celebrate
Hyatt Zilara Cancun,Utah,July 2022,5,Wonderful relaxing weekend getaway!!! Amazing service from entire staff.,"My wife and I took advantage of the long July 4th weekend and jumped over to Cancun for a much needed Adult only relaxing weekend. The Zilara resort exceeded all expectations that we had in this price point. It was a Very good experience and the entire staff was amazing!. Everyone was very eager to please and so very friendly. The Spa was one of the top 3 that we have ever visited, and the list is long. The messages were absolutely wonderful, Thank you Yohana and Karen!

Hyatt Zilara Cancun,Utah,July 2022,3,Cancun Zilara,Food was just ok not excellent‚Ä¶ Afternoon pool music was too loud I couldn‚Äôt sleep and it was very hard to stay in the room.

Hyatt Zilara Cancun,Utah,July 2022,5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"After a difficult year I just wanted to escape and relax for a while. Hotel Zilara was the perfect place! We rented a cabana and spent most of the day resting on the beach.. Drinks were brought regularly and we jumped in the ocean or the pool to cool off periodically. The food was delicious every where but breakfast at Punta was outstanding. Truly felt like we were in paradise with the view, delicious food (highly recommend the avocado toast and the French toast) and great service. At night, swaying in the hammock listen to the waves and looking at the night sky was the most relaxed feeling I have had in months. There was partying at the pool but we chose not to participate and it did not disturb my nap on the beach. Ana at the concierge desk was a big help getting our ride the"

Have been to several all-inclusive resorts and this is by far one of, if not, the best in terms of food. Special shout out to Memo at Maria Marie restaurant for his exceptional service and for making our dining experience memorable. Staff also went above and beyond to create an amazing spa experience and set up outdoor massages for five of us underneath a gazebo where we could listen to the waves during our massages. It was heavenly! Another special shout out to Miguel in the spa for his service and efforts to ensure that we had a really great time.

Hyatt Zilara Cancun,"Check, Virginia",June 2022,5,Paradise in Cancun!,"Hotel Zilara was a stunning resort! The suites are spacious and we loved the swim up room! There was nightly entertainment that was so fun! Plenty to do, at the pool and the beach. The only negative was the seaweed but the resort cleaned it daily off beach, and it wasn‚Äôt completely in water so could always find place to go in. The staff are warm and very friendly, you will feel spoiled! David John was our bell boy when we left and provided excellent service and attention!"
