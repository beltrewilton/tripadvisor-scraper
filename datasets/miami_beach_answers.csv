11,Sndr23,Jun 2018,"Hi, Yes we were staying in the newer part, which room-wise looked like it belonged to the main building. Style wise it is contemporary, colonial style. i liked it al lot, but it is not your clean bright white modern hotel like the SLS.. but then again, prices of those hotels are lot higher also.. Hope I could help. Sander",2
11,Roberta C,Jan 2020,"Yes - there are two wings in the Betsy. I only saw one wing, however.",0
11,Burton B,Jul 2019,"You cannot go wrong with either room choice in either building. Both buildings are old, Deco Wing has been more recently renovated but the original Betsy Building on Ocean Drive cannot be beat.",0
11,theniclangille,Jun 2018,"There is a newer side, and the rooms are quite lovely, we had an outside terrace which could have used some sprucing up. And there are lots of hard edges on the furniture inside so we move md things around a bit to create some more space and avoid banged knees! Staff are amazing at this hotel and the food is terrific. Great cocktails too. My favourite was the Hemingway Daiquiri. We‚Äôve stayed many places in South Beach and the Betsy is one of my favourites so far!",-1
11,mertrip13,Jun 2018,Having read through the posts I think I have some questions answered but would appreciate a weigh in on the room types & differences.,-1

12,flowers085,Apr 2019,To my knowledge there is no topless sun bathing.,0
12,WDWJr,Mar 2018,Not that I was aware of... but they actually have two separate pools areas... so it would be a perfect set up to allow it... As Someone else noted.... Regardless....

14,flybeLondon_England,Jan 2018,We were charged just over 30 dollars per room per day whether you use facilities or not.

16,derekbrown112,Dec 2017,"The Art Deco building is the new part, facing on to Collins Street. If you want a beach/ sea view you need to be in the Colonial Building, which is more convenient for the hotel entrance, restaurant etc. The roof top pool is in the Art Deco part. Noise is the main issue on both Ocean Drive and Collins, so you might prefer a room in between. in either part. (Ear plugs are provided.)",0

17,jeant831,Jan 2018,"Parking in South Beach is like trying to park in Oxford. It's expensive & difficult. If you can afford the $45 for the valet, do it. There are self-park lots nearby for $15-20 a night. Download an app called Best Parking. It's very helpful for many cities.",0
17,jeant831,Jan 2018,Valet at the hotel around $45 plus taxes. Probably just as easy to find a self-park lot nearby for much less. I had no car just for this reason. It's pricey.,0
17,Bigboy1959,Dec 2017,$10/day,0
17,sandyman57,Dec 2017,"Hi As with the rest of the Betsy prices, parking at the hotel is expensive! According to the local parking on Google the Betsy is $43 for 24 hours. Down the road there is parking on 1500 15th St for $10 a day. Take a look via google by typing in local parking to the Bestsy on South Beach and the options for booking will be there. Cheers",0
17,wrp57,Dec 2017,"I used valet, plus I can remember the cost",0
18,Equality_7-2521,Oct 2017,I believe that the new wing (Deco) has the bigger rooms (we stayed there). It is an absolute schlep to get there though.,1
18,08062003,Oct 2017,We stayed in a suite in the old part and then were moved to the new part after a leaky window - the new side suites are much bigger but the main bedroom had only 1 bed -a king size bed where as the older side main bedroom had 2 queensize beds,0

20,Mats B,Jun 2017,Yes they have a place to store luggage..,0
21,Rosiewill,Jun 2017,"You know that it has 2 pools? A courtyard one (always quiet, loads of space, just next to reception so super easy access for anyone with walking or mobility issues) and a busier but nicer rooftop pool which is trickier to access as your room maybe in a different wing to the hotel. I was there in April and courtyard pool was deathly quiet (think I saw a couple of older people there once in 4 days) and the rooftop pool was busier but never packed and always possible to get sun loungers, even over a weekend. The beach is across the road, maybe a 5 min walk for the able bodied but plenty of loungers and umbrellas all included in your resort fee. So plenty of options for you and your mum to sun bathe. It's a fab hotel, highly recommended.",1
21,DeeAnn D,Jun 2017,We didn't have an issue getting a chair. It's not too crowded up there at all.,1
21,dyann s,Jun 2017,I visited in May and was always able to secure an umbrella and lounge chairs. The attendants are very helpful and will assist you. Be aware that the UV rays are extreme and can burn you quickly. I agree that the courtyard pool was quieter with easy access from the lobby. The Betsy was lovely. I hope you and your Mother have a great time,1
21,5tacy,Jun 2017,"I never bothered w the rooftop pool. I preferred the courtyard pool. Easy access to bar, restaurant and bathrooms all w A/C, and since its surrounded by the hotel, it's very shady. This may be a better option for an older person to enjoy.",1
21,sunshine810,Jun 2017,I was there in Feb of this year and it was around supper time when we went to see the pool. We had been at the beach earlier. There was no one in the pool at that time of day so I can't say if it is a better choice than the beach. The weather was perfect so I assume everyone was across the street at the beach. It is a bit of a trek across the street but the beach is beautiful.,1
21,TaylorMadeJourneys,Jun 2017,"Hello the rooftop pool area is very nice and had lots of room. There is another side to the rooftop that has sofas, chairs and tables. All with a view of the city. Enjoy your stay!",0
21,Jackie H,Jun 2017,I guess its very much dependent on the time of year? we visited in late Jan this year and it wasn't busy at all and no sign of anyone securing their place? I think a lot of people prefer the beach?,0
22,SteveBfreqtraveler,May 2017,The hotel said that they dont rent umbrellas and chairs etc. they referred us to the concession on the beach. It cost us $20 per reclining chair with 1 umbrella included from the concession. The hotel did lend us beach towels at no charge. They said it was covered by the resort fee of $30 daily.,1
22,drummer'sgirl,May 2017,The beach chairs and umbrella are included in your resort fee. I always tip the set up person. Many hotels in Miami Beach don't include the umbrella and some not even the chairs so it's nice to have that included!,1
22,5tacy,May 2017,"There is a $30 resort fee for each day of your stay. That includes beach chairs and beach towels as well as use of pool, fitness room, spa, etc. However, the hotel waved the fee b/c I'm a returning guest. I'm not sure if that's the norm, but it's much appreciated!",1
22,Lars B,May 2017,It was all included in the resort fee. Lars,1
22,Ronald M,May 2017,"Yes - al hotels in the area charge heavily for beach facilities. we found it better to walk along the beach and find private beach Companies , who charge much less and are only a minute or two away.",1
22,Terry S,May 2017,no charge part of the daily resort fee but don't take what looks like a complementary canvas bag in the room--they charged $15 and parking was l $40/50 per day,1
22,NewYorkTravelor,May 2017,I recall that they were free but a tip was expected.,1
22,manhattanite2019,May 2017,"I don't think so, but my memory is hazy as to whether you get both the chair and the umbrella free. I'm fairly sure they are free. Of course, I did give a tip to the guy who set up the beach chair. Just call the hotel and ask.",1
23,Mats B,Jun 2017,They have valet parking. But there is other parking places (house) nearby much better price. Look att google. 24 hour parking..,0
23,jackie075,Apr 2017,They certainly had Valet parking. Unsure about a nearby lot. Google Maps can usually identify those.,0

23,jane C,Apr 2017,Sorry we did not travel my. at so cannot help but most hotels there had valet parking.,0

24,Philip H,Apr 2017,Across the street from the park and 150 meters from the beech.,0
24,Terry S,Apr 2017,It's as close as you can get in South Beach and a great location--beach chairs and umbrellas are part of the resort fee you pay--their rooftop pool is also wonderful and has an oceanvew,0
24,NewYorkTravelor,Apr 2017,It's not right on the ocean. You have to cross a street and a park to get to the ocean. It's close but not beachfront.,0

26,edtealdi,Mar 2017,"Very little sun in the pool area. It is surrounded by buildings. Not high rises, but certainly sizeable. My memories of the pool are of it being in the shade. It portably gets some hours of sunshine in the middle of the day, particularly in summer, but not so much. Second question, I don't know, sorry. Never been to the beach.",0
26,Road Warrior,Feb 2017,The pool on the roof get sun all day. The beach service is about 150 yards from the front of the hotel and is good with umbrellas and chairs with plenty of towels. Get there early say 9:45 to get close to the water. Concessions are limited and rest room a 150 yard walk.,0
26,Road Warrior,Feb 2017,There are two pools. The original on the first floor is surrounded by the Betsy but is still nice if you can't take a lot of sun. The new pool on the roof is in the sun all day and has a view out across the city and towards the beach.,0

27,aliweekes,Aug 2017,Don't get the super shuttle if you fly into Miami we did and it took forever and was really expensive considering we shared with 7 other people. An uber is definitely the best option only about 10-15 dollars for 2 of us whereas the shuttle was 35 dollars for 2!!,0

38,leandroalobo,Nov 2015,"I went there ready for noise, because it was one of the two complaints I read people writing about it, but for my surprise I didn't hear a thing when I was there. The room I stayed (with a pool view) it was absolutely quiet, totally silent, definitely no noise problem at all. Regarding the view, from the coffee room / restaurant we were unable to see the pool due to obstructions for the construction around the pool.

We have completed the change of our new restaurant and it is open already, LT Steak & Seafood, added another elevator into the original building, and as I mentioned, are heading towards opening the expanded Betsy with more room and suite options (many with balconies), several culinary options, a proper library, and even more cultural, caring and hospitable service options for you. We can't wait to hear what you think of it all! Jeff Lehman Managing Director",1 vote

54,Maria M√¥nica Ferro,Jul 2015,"Ola cynthia Boa tarde, o hotel nao tem estacionamento pp. funciona na frente do hotel valet custa $ 30:00 dolares. Mas vc tera que dar gorjetas o custo sai por volta de $40:00por dia. E alto o custo nao vale a pena pq o hotel esta proximo de tudo. Vc pode pegar um onibus para ir aos outlets. Custa em media $20:00 dolares por pessoa. O taxi fica por volta de $50 a 100 dolares depende para onde vc. For. Por outro lado vc pode pegar onibus na lincon road para ir a varios lugares vale a pena no hotel eles te darao toda dica de transporte. Por outro lado o carro fica mais carro pq vc nao paga so o estacionamento do mas sim na rua, bem como nos moll ou outlet. Eu vou todo anoa para miami so aluguei carro uma vez. Para ficar nessa localidade vc faz tudo a pe ou com onibus.",0

You will be asked to call the ‚Äòconcierge‚Äô as you approach the hotel for your private check-in but in fact it‚Äôs because they are renting rooms privately within the hotel. There‚Äôs a sign in the lobby that you can‚Äôt use the pool or the lobby area and no room service. Etc. I doubt there‚Äôs anywhere for left luggage as you can‚Äôt use the reception. My advice is stay in the actual hotel or somewhere else.,0

We arrived as the space was opening (believe 10:00am), only to be told that EVERY lounge chair was reserved, much less cabana availability. We did go up on the evening of our FIRST night, for a drink and to watch the sunset, and could not have been treated better by the bartender & a pool waiter, who showed us the best vantage point to relax & watch the sunset (happened to be in the lounge of the outdoor restroom, facing east.....:).",0

There is a roof top pool and bar and it looked really nice but because of the rain we didn't get to use it. I would imagine that would be a fairly lively scene at night. The 1 Hotel is situated pretty near all the action happening in South Beach so you won't be too lonely.,0

100,mauibound3,Jun 2018,I‚Äôm not sure....I would think for sure you could eat at their restaurants. You do need a room key to access the upper floor where the roof top pool and bar/resturant is. But there is also an attendant right at the elevators. As for the pool not so sure. Probably if you informed them you were a guest for just the day. They must have day passes maybe for a fee. Worth a call to ask!,0

127,pwc2017,Feb 2017,I am not sure but the water was warm and very comfortable.,0
128,chris s,Feb 2017,the pool area and spa are both very relaxed. The main bar in the lobby does get crowded and noisy. The main restaurant is calm and quiet. I think you will enjoy your stay. I'm 52 and had a great time.... It does have a young feel. its not the Ritz or four seasons... which are also very nice.,1
129,Samuel J,Feb 2017,"Hey Jeri, Yes there is beach service with food and drink. It is virtually the same menu as the pool. In terms of the pool there are three of them. Two of them are side by side (second being more of a extra large jacuzzi) and one is a level lower. They are fairly large but large enough for lap swimming. If you want to rose early and lap swim you can use the pool adjacent to the connected ""Roney Palace"" and that is large enough to do laps. Most guests simply use the pools to get wet, tan and play with kids. In regards to the noise level of Collins, it is far enough down hat is removed from the major party area and maintains Avery calm demeanor and low noise level. If you're coming from the airport you can arrange for a car to pick you up. The 1 hotel is all about sustainability and being green, so you'll be picked up in a Tesla Model S. I hope this helps! Cheers Sam",1
130,Douglas P,Jan 2017,"If you are considering Miami Beach for your honeymoon then I would consider 1 Hotel. The room is great for honeymooners: bed is wonderful with a great bathroom and large tub (and two vanities) with a separate shower. The hotel is beautiful with top-notch service. And, you MUST go to BeachCraft. We did a 20th wedding anniversary dinner here and were blown away by the food, service, and ambience.",0
131,chigirl7,Feb 2017,I do believe it is custom for the hotel. The soaps and lotions have a very woodsy scent- not your typical brands- not perfumery and not generic. I don't mind the soap but the lotion is a bit too woodsy/cedar for my taste.,0

144,Hoythouse804,Aug 2019,"TALLAHASSEE, Florida- The state of Florida has made a bold change to its laws concerning nudity at public beaches, and this one might ruffle some feathers. Beginning August 1st, 2015 full nudity will be legal at all public beaches ‚Äì as long as you obtain a Florida State Nudity License (FSNL). Governor Rick Scott approved the bill passed by the state legislature making public nudity at state-owned beaches legal, and he encourages tourists and residents to make use of new law. ‚ÄúToday is a great day. Not only will it be legal to hang out at the beach totally nude, but we encourage you do to so,‚Äù Governor Scott said. ‚ÄúAs long as you are a fairly attractive person, nobody is going to complain.‚Äù",0

The room was amazing.. None the less. Massive in size, ultra modern. It's worth the money imo A couple of things to keep in mind. Firstly they are doing renovation work at the hotel so monday to friday so it's a bit noisy around the main pool area on level 3 where you can hear building works going on. If you don't have kids, no problem because you can use the pool on the roof and no reno work up there. ( But kids under 21 can't go up there)..",0

The atmosphere in Miami now is , as you know much like an even wilder Las Vegas and there are a lot of things going on here you might not feel comfortable exposing a child to. But i guess at 1 years old, they don't really comprehend all this anyway. That said, the Mondrian is a lovely hotel with a friendly staff and way over on Biscayne Bay so you have a beautiful view and are far away from the trash that you see on Ocean Drive .

There were quite a few families that had kids there. The weekends have a DJ at the pool. I did not notice any kids menus as well. We love the hotel, but I'm not sure if I would necessarily chose to stay there with a one year old. SB has many other hotels that specifically have a kid friendly environment with pools that are geared towards the little ones.",2
226,Kourt92,Sep 2016,"Honestly the decision is up to you. The lower bar does offer a kid menu and there were some families there. I saw about 4 kids in the pool during a pool party it didn't bother anyone. However this is sort of a party hotel (pool party, bar, lots of liquor).",1

241,Ellis V,Oct 2015,"Hi. Thank you for your inquiry. We are located on Biscayne Bay. We offer a unique setting here which allows for uninterrupted sunshine from mid-day until sunset (the sunsets are bucket list-worthy!); as such, we do not have a beach per se, but a comfortable pool deck with million-dollar views. You may see pictures of this online. There are options for enjoying the beach, at our sister property or along the expanse. Our concierge can direct you to a location of your preference, as different areas have different vibes dependent on the local color it attracts. We are about 10 short blocks away from the beach--a journey through Art Deco buildings and tree-lined avenues and streets. Some prefer to walk while others take one of the bikes available at through the Concierge--these are free and available on a first-come, first served basis. There is a DecoBike station across the street, and of course taxis, Uber and Lyft. We hope to welcome you soon. Do feel free to contact me directly if I may be of any additional service. Best regards, Ellis Guest Experience Manager",0
241,Canadian_Architect,Oct 2015,I stay at Mondrian once a year and walk to the beach daily. It takes about 20 minutes. For me this easy and enjoyable. It is nicer to reside on the Bay side and enjoy the sunset on Miami than to be amongst the crasiness of the beach side.,0

244,Nicole G,Aug 2015,"Hi Aly1713, Thank you for connecting with us via TripAdvisor. The hotel is located on the bay side of South Beach (rather than the beach side), our property has an amazing view, the pool deck overlooks Biscayne Bay and the Miami skyline (check out some of our guests pictures). We are located about a mile away from Ocean Drive which is a touristic area and is the road that runs along the beach. Its a 15 min walk, short bike ride, or 5 min car ride, with plenty of taxi's and Ubers available at all times. Lincoln Road is also a popular area with plenty of shopping and dining options (people watching is fun here too). The great thing about Lincoln road is that it runs all the way from our side of South Beach down to Ocean Drive, so its a entertaining route to take if you are planning on walking from here to the beach. It begins only 5 blocks north of our hotel. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Nicole Goddard Executive Assistant",0
245,Ellis V,Jul 2015,"Hi Georgia, We look forward to your visit in May. We offer valet parking at $39/night per vehicle. Our team out there is great (just look for Dwight's mentions here). Other options include as follows: There is a public garage 1 1/2 blocks to our South and the charge there is $15/day--keep in mind, however, that you do not receive in/out privileges there and you will be walking in the elements. Others have posted before about street parking--be very careful and aware of the time as the streets convert to residential parking in the evenings. I speak first hand of the pain and expense of having that ""free parking"" space up costing over $200 due to fines and a tow. Additionally, there are some metered spaces on Alton Rd. Parking is limited and therefore expensive in South Beach. There's a good Travel Forum discussion about this subject here on Trip Advisor. My recommendation is to evaluate if you really need a car during your stay. With ride-sharing services, bike sharing programs, and of course, taxis, it's much easier and cost-effective to use these means of getting about South Beach. I have messaged you directly to provide contact details of one of our phenomenal Front Desk Managers who can assist in getting you into a Bay View room. As I've said before, these rooms are in great demand and are rarely available to upgrade to once you arrive--particularly if your visit is over a weekend. It's good that you are taking care of that in advance. Thank you again, Georgia. I look forward to continuing our chat, getting acquainted with you, and helping you to create a memorable Mondrian Experience for you and your partner. Best regards, Ellis",1 vote

247,Ellis V,Jul 2015,"Hi, thank you for your reservation. We look forward to your visit. We typically have DJ's poolside on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. Max, who handles our programming, does an excellent job of bringing in talent to help curate a fun and energetic vibe without being over the top or obscene as can be the case with other pool parties in South Beach. In fact, our weekend scene is enjoyed by most, regardless of age. From time to time, we do bring in a DJ on Fridays--usually on a holiday weekend. We invite you to check out the ""Happenings"" section under the ""Back of House"" tab on our website for a calendar of events. We currently offer the ""Beat the Clock"" Happy Hour on Friday evenings between 6pm and 9pm in Sunset Lounge.

We are often able to offer a late checkout, sometimes complimentary, if occupancy allows. I welcome you to contact me directly so that I can look at your reservation and make note. Also, keep in mind, that time needs to be allowed for evening flights from either MIA or FLL, particularly in the evening, due to rush hour traffic on our expressways, as well as potentially long lines through TSA Checkpoints, particularly at MIA.

250,Ellis V,May 2015,"Hello, and thank you for your inquiry. Many find our location on West Avenue desirable for the reason you seek--we are off the beaten path and therefore quieter than many hotels on Collins or Ocean Drive, and the Bay Views we offer are indeed spectacular. As you read, we have pool parties on Saturdays and Sundays which typically get going around 1:00 until sunset. Please note that our vibe is much more relaxed than many other pool parties in South Beach. We attract a sizable and nice looking crowd, but the volume of our music level is quite tame. We are located on 11th Street, 6 blocks (10-15 minute walk) South of Lincoln Road, our pedestrian mall which offers many shopping and dining options.

We are located on West Avenue, about 12 blocks from the Ocean--this is approximately a 5 minute taxi or Uber ride or a 20 minute walk through Flamingo Park and among streets lined with beautiful Art Deco buildings. Our guests can access the Delano Beach Club, there is a charge of $25/chair and $25/umbrella. As you will be a Mondrian guest, you can place these charges to your room, This section, like all of Miami Beach, is open to the public so availability is based upon a first-come, first-served basis. There are other sections available on the beach where chairs are less expensive, but I must say that the loungers at the Delano Beach Club are the most plush and comfortable available, plus the Food and Beverage service is top notch. You may access the Delano Beach through the public access walkway on 17th Street. Our pool deck receives sun from about noon through to sunset (which are amazing from our setting!). Lounge chairs are available complimentary for hotel guests on a first come, first served basis. Day Beds and Cabanas are available for a minimum spend which varies based on the day of the week and occupancy.

265,Pam B,Apr 2022,"I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre apologizing. You did meet my expectations (initially there were some bumps with the rooms, but all was resolved very well with care and grace by Martha at the front desk). Maybe my review was confused with someone else? We just had a great five days with you at The Nautilus. The pool staff, Daja, John and Frederic were all helpful and friendly every day. And Martha and Jesus and others at the front went out of their way to make sure that thins went well.",0
266,Emily C,Jun 2022,I did it by calling them.,0
267,Kaleigh,Jan 2022,It's definitely not an all inclusive,0
268,F L,Jan 2022,The place is safe. Location is perfect . But ready my review‚Ä¶,1
268,renee m,Jan 2022,I would consider this area very safe. It‚Äôs convenient to mini things and you can ride the bikes in the area. The hotel says they offer bikes but they don‚Äôt work very well or they‚Äôre very tricky. They do have very nice E bikes around the corner. You can download the app.,0
268,Bella P,Jan 2022,Its s a very nice hotel with a great location.,0
268,Jennifer B,Jan 2022,"I definitely would! It‚Äôs walking distance to many other great areas of south beach and also the hotel itself is very entertaining but not in a loud, party way. The lounge bar is very chill so you can go and have a drink and dinner there at night if you don‚Äôt feel like going somewhere alone. Anthony the bartender is very nice and makes amazing drinks. Also, the pool during the day is chill but fun. You can ask for Nicolas or Julian to help you out, they really made my stay extra special. Have fun!",0
268,Sophia S,Jan 2022,Absolutely!!! It's right near Lincoln road & all the great restaurants & shops plus it's right on the beach. Doorman 24/7 so it's safe clean & beautiful inside & out,0
268,Edward Overstreet,Jan 2022,"Yes, great location, walking distance to just about everything. Uber/Lyft ride share is available as well. Have lunch or dinner at the Ocean Grill restaurant right next door. Quite tasty. Don‚Äôt forget your sunblock!",0
268,Saadia M,Jan 2022,"Hi Erika Nautilus is one of the safest place you can think of with full access to the beach. The whole vibe of the hotel and the place is warm , inviting and their Cabana Club is pretty luxurious. We miss our time there and would want to go back all the time. It's for everyone, Singles, families, couples etc. Loved it. This was our second time staying there.",0
271,Rachel S,Apr 2021,Order an uber. No shuttle service.,0
272,Rachel S,Apr 2021,2 are included with your reservation. It's part of what the resort fee covers.,0
273,Rachel S,Apr 2021,Yes they are.,0
274,jess2art,Jul 2020,"No night swimming unfortunately. In fact, I don‚Äôt think any South Beach hotels allow for night swimming. The pool tended to close around dusk when I was there. Bummer, for sure.",0
275,Van der Kapiz,Jun 2020,Hallo. It could be but if I was you I would re consider the choice as the hotel and it services are pretty poot,0
276,Raiysa A,Aug 2020,The beach umbrellas are available for an extra rental fee of $17,1 vote
277,jess2art,Jun 2020,"Hi Olivia. I can only speak from my experience. The ocean view room was worth it to me. Turquoise and blue as far as the eye can see. As with basically all South Beach properties, the ocean and beach itself are viewable past the view of the hotel‚Äôs pool. Still gorgeous. But if you‚Äôre looking for a balcony room where you can hear the waves crashing, then an ocean view room in South Beach isn‚Äôt for you. As for the bathroom door - it‚Äôs a normal door that I didn‚Äôt have any issues with. I believe it can be locked. The bathrooms are quite small though, but I had no issue with that. Most hotels have small bathrooms. Not sure what exactly you‚Äôre referring to as far as free food but I do know you can upgrade your room to have breakfast included. I received this option and was very pleased. Breakfast was buffet style where you could pick and choose from both hot and cold items, as well as enjoy juices, coffee, or tea. I dined quite a bit at the hotel (mostly breakfast and lunches) and never had an issue with cleanliness (as the other responder mentions). As for the size of the room, I had an oceanfront king room with a balcony. It was just me this time so it was fine. I had space to store my suitcase and there was a corner chair to throw additional things on, plus a long table spanning the back of the width of the bed and a decent sized, deep closet. I suppose it would feel smaller if you were with two people, but to me, size-wise it felt like a standard South Beach room. Hope this helps.",2
278,Sean C,Mar 2020,No I don‚Äôt think so,0
279,jess2art,Jun 2020,"No extra charge for beach chairs - they're included - as are chaise lounges at the pool. You do need to go early to snag one though. And for a fee you can choose to ""upgrade"" your pool or beach experience by reserving a shaded cover or ""bed"" type thing.",0
280,William4222,Mar 2020,Yes but extremely small and no weight machines,1
281,Birbontella,Nov 2019,Yes! Right now it's until 11 pm. I learned it will be 24 hours starting Dec 1.,0
282,Karan Kakar,Oct 2019,"Good afternoon, This room can sleep 4 adult or a combination of up to 5 guests including children. Breakfast for 2 is included for some rate plan options, but not for all. The buffet breakfast is $25++ per adult and $12.50++ per child. The Ocean Terrace is a roof top deck with chairs and loungers over looking the ocean and pool area. Additional loungers are available for $17.",0
283,Michael D,Oct 2019,"I'd say the average age was in the low 30s. There was a party vibe throughout the hotel. In fact, I had to change rooms because someone was having a loud private party next door. While I didn't feel out of place exactly, I would have preferred something a little more refined and low-key.",1
283,◊©◊ú◊ï◊û◊ô◊™ ◊ê,Oct 2019,"Hi. Not at all! On the contrary, we didn't see kids or teens and felt terrific. Age is how you feel.",0
284,Yawar Mumtaz,Oct 2019,Yes absolutely you can put your alcohol in fridge. You can also request the house keeping or room service to take everything from mini bar so you can use all the space and refrigerator for your items .,0
284,Steven,Sep 2019,"Yes. We used the mini fridge for our alcohol. However, they had to empty the fridge themselves. As far as alcohol at the pool. You should be fine with a yeti cup. I took a small mesh cooler & nothing was said but I was discreet when pouring my drink into the plastic cups they give you when you order a drink. I saved their cup. :)",0

291,Liz S,Mar 2019,They only have cabanas in the pool area. Beach is umbrella and lounge chairs. You can purchase a lounger for 2 that has a slight canopy for privacy.,0

294,felipemaluf,Dec 2018,The cost of parking I believe to be 32U $ per day. The rooms with balcony are a bit more expensive and are very good. It is worth asking before you buy your trip.,0
295,REBLE,Aug 2018,"They do allow guests to ""party"" in their rooms however, it doesn't get out of hand.",3
296,Scenic367096,Aug 2018,We just grabbed an Uber from the airport. They do have parking but I‚Äôm not sure how much it is.,0
296,thetravelguru3000,Jul 2018,Yes. There is parking that cost between $35 and $40 per night. There are all day lots for $16 a day. You are better off using Uber or Lyft because the location is not far from the various attractions of South Beach. There is also shuttle transportation in South Beach that will take you to places like the Sawgrass Mall.,0
296,LMC_Canada,Jul 2018,"VALET parking is available. As with most hotels in South Beach it is expensive. There is a municipal lot not far (5-10 walk) which is much more reasonable but no in/out privileges,",0

This compares with in Europe outside the UK where you need normally need an adaptor with two slim rounded pins to fit their sockets. Wherever you are, the flimsiness of these arrangements compared with the stability of the UK three pin sockets means that heavier items that need plugging in may need support from underneath. The voltage in the US is half ours at 110 volts. By the way, if you are going on a cruise later, some of the boats are fitted with a combined US/European socket so you might be able to use either adaptor.

Given the hotel has over a thousands rooms, during the summer seasons I can definitely see there being an issue! The sun loungers are free and staff supply you with towels. However you will have to buy a umbrella at $25. Cabanas are also available at around ¬£340! We were offered 1 at $85 whilst it wasn‚Äôt very busy! I stayed in the Tresor tower, which is the tallest. We were given an upgrade to a suite. This was massive and had an amazing view of Miami, the hotel and the ocean! Can‚Äôt comment on the other buildings but I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll all be good. I never visited Liv club. Cardi B was on 1 night and tickets were $200! We really weren‚Äôt that interested in that! The hotel is amazing. The hotel is also ridiculously expensive! Over the weekend the hotel guests goes through the roof! From Friday afternoon an endless line of Ferrari‚Äôs, bentleys and Lamborghinis started arriving! It‚Äôs definitely a place for the Instagram kids! If you have money to burn then you‚Äôll have a great time!",1
433,LARRY S,May 2019,"See 229's response, it is right on. I would suggest changing to ocean view if possible, if u r already coming all this way.

433,Valarie M,May 2019,"The pool seats do fill up, but the attendants are very helpful with finding seats and bringing umbrellas over. Unless you want to have a prime seat poolside, you should be fine. The best tip would be to go down around 8am to get the best seat(s) and leave a magazine or some items on the chairs to save them. The cabanas do have to be rented, but that is the norm here, for any good hotel with a pool. The bayside rooms are okay. You overlook a Main Street, but also a canal with yachts and mansion homes. The beach view rooms with balconies are very nice. I‚Äôm not sure where the LIV tower is. I‚Äôve stayed there 3 times now and would definitely return. The staff are friendly and attentive and the hotel is very clean The only thing that shocked me this time was the apparel, or lack of,that the young women were wearing, but I heard that there was a festival or rave in town that would explain that. Also, the hotel, I feel, is in one of the safer places of Miami. When we first arrived this time we stayed at a different hotel and immediately check out. It was not safe, so I checked us in to the Fontainebleau. I hope this was somewhat helpful. I hope you have a nice trip.",1

A better question is why are there is the ‚Äúamazing‚Äù reviews that come from reviewers who have never posted a single review before and all of a sudden pop up to give one.

439,Sentient M,Feb 2019,"Unfortunately, you are indeed right to dread this property. The way this property is managed alongside the outlandish prices it charges both guests and non-guests should be illegal. This place is a full-fledged d-bag riddled party spot for the most obnoxious, pretentious, self-absorbed, fake, and ridiculously rude locals and tourists that use this place as as platform to get obscenely drunk and use drugs. The store on Lincoln road are alright, not great, not bad. You are better off venturing down to Bal Harbour or Brickell. There are a few places local to the hotel. Get prepared to take uber, or you might be able to catch a free trolley which is pretty decent. South beach overall is an abyss! It is extremely, EXTREMELY ghetto, and riddled with all sorts of unsavories ranging from streetwalker prostitutes and drug dealers on just about every corner of Collins and Ocean Dr. All of the local area businesses are complete and total rip-offs! I am not talking expensive, I am talking about jaw-dropping robbery without the handgun or ski-mask!",3
439,jbrenz,Feb 2019,"I stayed next door at the Holiday Inn and stopped over at the FB just to see it. I found there is a free bus that you can take from mid-beach where the hotel is down to Lincoln Road. You can pick up the bus directly across the street from FB, next to Biscayne Bay. Take it down to South Beach/Lincoln Road and save your feet the walking. I had dinner down at Lincoln Road and found that the buses were too crowded to ever get one back to the Holiday Inn/Fontainebleau, so I walked it. It‚Äôs a bit of a hike, 2 miles or so, and it was not that bad. I walked down Collins Avenue, and I did not have any issues with homeless, street walkers, etc. bothering me and I was a woman walking with another female friend. At the corner of 43rd Street and Collins, there is a little bar, Beaches, that is great for appetizers and drinks and it‚Äôs about as down-to-earth and not snooty like at the FB. And yes, if you don‚Äôt want to mess with the free bus, you can take an uber or cab from the hotel with no problem as the hotels are swamped with cabs.",2
439,InnerBanksGary,Mar 2019,"Sorry, Maureen, for the delay. There‚Äôs a coffee bar in the hotel that is very nice. A car is a minus. Lincoln Road is not within walking distance. But I agree....I think a more positive expectation will be rewarded.",1
439,jclingo,Feb 2019,"Since you have no choice in the matter of taking the trip, just remember that all experiences really lay within what you make out of it. If you see my review of this hotel, you'll see the fun I did have was because of my company. You can always make the best of something if you want to and as a New Yorker that was looking to escape the cold, I was grateful to feel the warmth of the sun. I hope you find a way to enjoy your trip.",1
439,Sentient M,Feb 2019,"The Fountainbleau and attached LIV nightclub is an embarassment to the hospitality industry. It is just another relic like many others living on decades past reputation. Poor service is attributed to the dismal wages that these privately owned businesses pay their employees. Most employees are also unequipped foreigners with freshly minted work visas, and are hired on the basis of working for offensive wages that most others with a shred of common sense would decline.",1
439,150hotelnightsayear,Feb 2019,"Hard to top Sentient M‚Äôs response. The coffee in the lobby coffee shop is priced consistent with most hotels and is better than Starbucks- $5-6 for a large specialty coffee. Double check your bill - gratuity is usually added. Actually I think the coffee was the only reasonably priced item in the entire hotel. There is a small liquor store walkable under 10 min located by the Cadillac hotel. Along the way there are a few other restaurants too - this is Collins St, but not South Beach side as referenced by Sentient M. There is a Subway over there too if you want super basic. Uber is super easy and taxis were always waiting. On the positive side - the views are nice regardless of which direction your room faces. There are also really good restaurants in Miami. So don‚Äôt despair- there are things to enjoy outside of this property!",1

I would discuss with the hotel staff prior to about accessibility needs within the rooms (i.e. push buttons, handle bars, lowered sinks, etc.). Though I am near certain they are able to accommodate. In terms of beach access, you might have to go a few blocks for their to be a ramp to access the beach as I do not believe there is accessible access to the beach from the boardwalk in front of the hotel, once again I would advise asking a staff member to find out the closest beach access for individuals who use a wheelchair.",1

485,Achimmah,Apr 2017,I pre-paid for one night and determined to pay for the second night upon checkout. Taxes are identified on most lodging websites so that should not be a surprise. The hotel does charge $35.00/ night if you decide to use the valet service. Self parking can be a pain if you need to circle the area for a vacant spot (and you still have to pay to park.

I'm sure there may be a parking fee if you drive your own car, as parking is at a premium there. The breakfast, which was a little more than continental, was totally free, and very welcomed before we left for port. They have a restaurant for any dinners that may be pricey, but ALL restaurants in South Beach are pricey! Be aware that we bought a Margarita at a cafe on South Beach, and it cost $25!

Also u get a credit (maybe $10?) that can be used at the bar for food and drink. We used it for an overpriced pina colada. It also includes all the Daylife activities - some for kids and some for adults. Two of us did the morning workout for free and loved it. We didn't use the free lounge chairs at the beach though.

It was about a 10 minute walk on the main street - Ocean Drive. There is a free bus running up and down Ocean Drive - but I have never used it. I would sugest dropping your luggage off at the hotel, checking in and then taking your car back. Some car rental services will provide a ride back to the hotel. When I booked my rental car, I saw many other car rental services near the hotel.",1

646,MPKC,Apr 2019,I have not seen any rental car offices close to the Surfcomber or in Miami Beach...but I imagine they are there somewhere? Probably best to check with the rental company to see if they have offices in Miami Beach/South Beach area.,0

Your best bet is either to grab a taxi, which is a $35 flat fare to anywhere on Miami Beach, or to download the Uber app and call and Uber, which is usually cheaper but is not a flat rate. Some of our rates do include a continental breakfast, or you can dine a la carte in the Social Club, our restaurant, which is getting pretty well known for its excellent brunch. - Nora",0

Parking is $42 plus tax per night with unlimited in and out privileges. If you're going to use your car while you're here, it's usually cheaper to park with us. If you aren't going to use your car while you're here, I recommend either returning to the rental (we're in easy walking distance of a LOT) or using the public garage on 16th street and Collins Ave.",1

738,Lisa S.,Dec 2020,The hotel does offer room cleaning on the 3rd day of your stay. If you stay less then 3 nights your room will not be cleaned. I do not know the extra fee for a pool chair as that is included in each guests daily resort fee. You will have to call the front desk to ask. I‚Äôm not sure they will allow outside guests at the pool though because space is limited. Chairs are spaced out to accommodate for social distancing measures.,-1 vote

803,Hilary B,Sep 2015,"We left on a Friday after 4mostly enjoyable days On the Saturday there was going to be a pool party open to the public from midday. I would not have wanted to be there for that. Anticipated noise, over consumption of cocktails etc. aimed at a young crowd. Not I'd have thought child friendly. The hotel is aimed at twenty and thirty something singles if the promo playing on room TVs and in lifts is anything to go by. ( flash cars, cocktails, sultry looks, bad acting) As an older couple ( late 50s) with a sixteen year old son we found this irritating but that we could ignore it and enjoy the hotel and pool regardless. There were small children around mostly under 5 but families were in a minority If staying with children in the same room make sure in advance you get a big enough room. Regular rooms seem to have two small doubles in them (4ft) and rooms not really big enough for an extra rollaway bed",0

815,Rich L,Jan 2015,The only parking available was valet. They had to take the car off property for parking which means you need to call them 15-20 minutes in advance for your car to be brought around. They do a very good job given the difficult circumstances. Parking cost between 30 and 40 dollars per night.,0

The choices of mud are French Marine Clay, Red Earth Detoxifying Mud, Purifying Golden Body Mud or Spirulina Smoothing Mud.

It's a fun treatment, they give you everything you need - but it's not like some of the other treatments where you are with someone the entire time. You are pretty much paying for the mud as there's no fee for the outdoor space by the pool where you will do this experience. Also, as a guest of the hotel you can enjoy the humam and steam room free of charge. They also have a nail salon inside the spa and it was a highlight because my nails looked a mess. LOL. Enjoy!",0

1132,Jeanette K,May 2022,Thank you David M. One of the reasons why I decided not to book this hotel is the overwhelming number of these types of reviews plus your recent negative experience. It's frustrating to think that people are stupid enough to not see through these attempts. If the corporate is seeing this post please put an end to these types of reviews. It just turns people off!,0
1132,David M,May 2022,"Been reviewing here for several years. I was not impressed with this hotel on any level. I posted a bad review here and on the Marriott website. Marriott corporate obviously forwarded my review to the hotel management/ owners and someone called me to chat about my experience. They offered me some points, but not a refund, which I accepted. But this property is way past it's prime and did not justify the exorbitant rate, which I erroneously understated in my review.",0

1144,Alicia G,Sep 2020,They have some nice options at the hotel. A casual Mexican restaurant that served food on the beach and in a cantina type space. There's a really fine Asian restaurant too. Lots of options close by as well with outdoor spaces. Check out the hotel's website for more details. Staff was great and they had hand sanitizer everywhere when we visited.,2

1149,susannemedeiros3,Sep 2019,"There were families with young kids staying at the hotel when I was there. There is the pool and the beach for sure but the pool area does have a mature vibe as there is no shallow play area and no room on the deck to play. There is a very large chess board and things for older kids to do on the deck above the pool. Other guests didn‚Äôt seem to mind the young kids around the pool but the parents did seem to feel the need to ask their kids to ‚Äúkeep it down‚Äù in and around the pool. As for inside the hotel, I didn‚Äôt see much for kids to do but I wasn‚Äôt looking either. Hope this helps.",0
1150,Lovetotravel5525,Jul 2019,I would say by 10am the lounges were full near the pool . I was there during a holiday week so it may less crowded other times. There is an upper deck where there are more chairs and it‚Äôs easier to get one. The pool staff keeps a wait list for chairs and also checks if someone hasn‚Äôt been at their lounge for a while it gets given up,2

1150,Edward,Jul 2019,Tltwo small pools but they are really good about not allowing people to stake out the chairs for friends that never appear or not do they allow people to hoard chairs.

Miami Beach and Miami at two separate towns/cities, so when searching for hotels, may sure you put in the right parameters. :)",0

1187,JJA1228,Aug 2017,They were in the process of opening a Starbucks when we were there in June. It wasn't near the pool so I wouldn't think it would affect it enough to close it. The biggest construction was next door and down a bit at another hotel.,0

1213,Annoush,Apr 2016,"Hi, I stayed president's day weekend and had a ocean view room. I think most of the rooms face the ocean, it is just a matter of how much of the ocean view that you get. When my husband and I stayed we did not encounter any issues with children at all, there were some older kids but to be honest the hotel is not really geared to children. The hotel is located south of fifth and it is in a very quiet neighborhood, but also a walking distance to all the action and also South Point. I notice you are from NYC so the walk to the restaurants are not very far, no need to uber or taxies to get around. That being said it is the best of both worlds since you have a beautiful beach right at your door step, it is located in a quiet neighborhood but you can walk to where the party is. The hotel is also very accommodating, you can have concierge organize any event/dining you plan on. Also there is a charge for the beach chairs, get there early if you want the chairs on the 1st row closest to the ocean. Trust me, people reserve them 1st thing in the morning when they get set up. I know its probably cheesy coming from NY, but the Smith & Wolinsky located in South Point is awesome place to get a drink and meal outdoors as the sun is setting. Awesome Vibe and location. You will have a blast! Happy Anniversary!",1

I noticed the label after and had to call the desk and let them know it was done by mistake and to please not charge items to the room. Lol.",0

1267,Traice,Jul 2019,To be honest you reall need at least 120$ a day to eat and be comfortable that‚Äôs with eating 3 times a day. If you drink then you know your going to need more with the 2 of us we spent around 650$ but we did try different food. The Havana food was delicious but be prepared to spend some money in Miami you don‚Äôt want to go and eat the same food you eat in your home town. From Thursday to Sunday 650$ covered about everything including the duck tour,1

People were having sex in the upper pool so did not go in there.If you plan on spending a lot of time there on the property, stay somewhere else but it costs...The Caribbean is better and far more interesting than Miami. There, I said it.",2

To eat, Rosetta Bakery 166 Collins Ave is great for a quick juice, coffee and bakery items.

1314,BobSquatch W,Oct 2016,"The larger pool is closed. The Staff told us that it would be like that until late November. The other pool is much smaller, but serves its purpose.

1314,CLP_Platinum,Oct 2016,"Yes, the second pool is decent but much smaller than then main pool at the hotel or any regular swimming pool.

The check in area is a zoo. Few workers and loads of folks checking in / out. There is also construction in the lobby are. There are plenty of nicer places around.,1
1321,Bartniki,Aug 2016,"Hi, I have just came back from Royal Palm: a really disaster for the level of hotel it should be.... The main pool and whirlpool are unavailable due to the work in progress. To go to to the beach you have to go through a work in progress area, dirty , noisy and with scaffoldings. The main hall and front desk area is also under construction. It means that people is crowded in a noisy small area where put in count to queue at list 30-40 minutes before having access to the desk. The Check in time should be 4 p m but the rooms are ready at 5. In this scenario nobody is available to assist you or to propose any sort of compensation . The first day we arrived at 2 pm we (finally) had the room at 5 ...we went to the beach at 5,30 and it closes at 6 so the beach boys told us that it was no more possible to have beach chaise and umbrella and anyway the hotel charged us 30$ for beach and swimming pool (????) service!",1

You may want to request a quieter room. I always have ear plugs with me. We also visited in the shoulder season. There will be more going on in January. Yes, there are lounge chairs and towels for free at the hotel‚Äôs designated area close by. We didn‚Äôt use the service but went to haulover park/beach instead. There was entertainment every night we were there, mostly one person on guitar or a small band. They were loud for my sensitive ears but they didn‚Äôt play late. Some were actually very good, pop or even music to dance to. We had a drink during Happy Hour and were able to meet other guests at that time. A guest told us that the shuttle service to the airport would be discontinued,maybe at the end of the year. You might want to check directly with the hotel. We‚Äôve been four times now. The food is delicious, Art Deco exceptional. Take a walking tour and visit the Wolfsonian if you like Art Deco. Walking the boardwalk is nice and I would just ride one of the free trolleys to get an overview. Hope that this was somewhat helpful.",1

1354,MiamiDiesel,Nov 2016,"As a guest, you will have access to all buildings within the property, which are all on a small side street of Collins Ave. To answer your question specifically, Building 3 has the rooftop pool. On the first floor is the bar so you can order drinks (though you may have to bring them up and down yourself depending on staff levels). Building 3 is the newest building of the property, and most of the rooms are of good size. Many of them have balconies as well (though be prepared to pay $30-$40/day extra) Rooms near the elevator of this building are TERRIBLE. Small square footage, full-size beds. Anything room number with 00 or 01 is a no-go. All rooms have a safe, mini-bar, and 2-piece bathroom with the toilet and shower separate from the sink, which is outside in the bedroom.

Hope this helps you!",0
1359,Rayniestarr,Aug 2016,Do they have a smoking area.,0
1360,imaearthaworm,Aug 2016,We followed the directions as it states on the hotel website for the Miami airport- we easily spotted the shuttle from the picture that is shown on the website- they will just pull up there is no waiting in a certain spot for you- you have to be watching for them and hail them just like a taxi. Also we were on the 3pm shuttle and they arrived a little before 3 and filled up and left before 3pm- so if you get off the plane make sure you head straight to the meeting spot door 17!,1
1360,ENGIN MALCOK,Jul 2016,I've flew in from Fort Lauderdale where there is no shuttle service. Your best bet should be contacting to the hotel and arrange shuttle times accordingly. I hope you enjoy your stay there...,1
1360,nadeanm2015,Jul 2016,20 mins after sounds correct but I'm not 100% sure if in doubt contact the hotel. I don't think the shuttle collects from Fort Lauderdale airport. I got the shuttle from Miami international.,1
1360,ENGIN MALCOK,Apr 2017,"Hi, Sorry about delayed answer, at first Fort Lauderdale Airport doesn't have a shuttle,but Miami Airport only. Hours can be learned from the hotel receptionist. As far as your concern about hotel itself will be satisfying your needs.",0
1361,Sandie M,Jul 2016,"The shuttle only goes every hour,so I would email them,they are very helpful and friendly,and I'm sure they would allow a late check out,but it would depend on availability,good luck",1
1362,betti14,Jul 2016,yes - you have to arrange through hotel,1
1362,Tony R,Jul 2016,We rented a car at MIA and did not use the shuttle. I suggest that you call the Riviera directly concerning their shuttle from the MIA..,1
1362,imaearthaworm,Aug 2016,"We did not set up the shuttle- it runs all of the time- you just follow the directions on the website- go to door 17 stand on the sidewalk, watch for the shuttle to show up ( make sure you know what the shuttle looks like from the website picture) because there is no stop point for them- you literally hail them like a cab",0
1362,DavidNJ732,Jul 2016,"Thanks everyone. However, the hotel includes a roundtrip shuttle. I was just wondering about setting up the times. I'll just call the hotel directly. Thanks.",0
1362,ENTERTAINMENTAMBDR,Jul 2016,you will need to get a cab and or use the shuttle the shuttle is probably cheaper I think its like thirty -forty bucks I forget the name but tis the blue and yellow van but this hotel has free shuttle when you depart from MIAMI. so you can set up the arrival prior to getting to the airport or just go to the stations in the departures its easy breezy,0
1363,ENTERTAINMENTAMBDR,Jul 2016,when I stayed it was really quiet after happy hour and its definitely a mixture I think its a little bit of everyone no specific age it is a bit from the strip and most young people want to stay close to the strip so I think you are fine either way it will be a mixture of people go to the happy hour free alcohol lol. Have fun and happy birthday,1
1363,William H,Jun 2016,"I did not get the impression that the hotel was geared to spring break guests. However I would say it is a good choice for the young at heart. If you're more concerned with what's the early bird special than what adventures you can join in on, you might be better off somewhere else. This is a fairly vibrant location.",1
1364,Lauren L,Apr 2016,Yes there are amenities in the rooms,0
1365,aquarius6502,Apr 2016,Yes they have!,0
1367,martiniguy63,Mar 2016,"Yes. If you tell the concierge that you want to go to the beach we will give you towels and a voucher for beach chairs and direction how to get there. It's short walk. The beach club area also rents for an fee umbrellas. There are waiters on the beach and you can purchase food and beverages, alcoholic and non-alcoholic, from them without leaving your chair. Just word of warning about beverages. There are no public bathrooms on the beach. When I asked about the closest bathroom while one the beach I was told if I didn't want to use ""big blue"" the closest was probably my hotel. Enjoy!",0
1367,Mara M,Mar 2016,The hotel privides towels for the swimming pool that I think you can also use for the beach. There is not a private area to the beach and I didn't see any beach chairs,0

I see you are interested in transportation around the city. Our hotel does offer a complimentary electric car for short transportation to and from our sister hotels. For the wedding in Coral Gardens, our service would not be able to complete the transportation for you and your companions to this area. If you get in contact with our concierge Pedro Alvarado (phone number: 305-538-7444, Ext. 3600), he can give you the best options of transportation.

Appreciate everyones input!!",0
1371,4tdev,Jul 2015,"I agree with Porsha, Uber and walking are the best ways to get around. I also agree you should stay someplace else.",0
1371,A Tripadvisor Member,Jul 2015,"I'm not familiar with Coral Gardens, but if you mean Coral Gables, the Riviera is about 15 miles away and with traffic it can take 30 - 40 minutes to get there. If you are planning to visit a lot of sites in the greater-Miami area, you are better off renting a car because public transportation is not great. If you prefer to spend most of your time enjoying the beach, art galleries, shopping, and dining in South Beach (where the Riviera is) you don't need a car. Everything is within walking distance from the hotel.",0
1371,Porsha L,Jul 2015,"Hi. My recommendation would be to use Uber. It's cheaper than a taxi and the drivers get to you within minutes. I'm also an Uber driver in Atlanta and it's the new way to get around nowadays. The hotel will not be any help to you. You may want to consider staying somewhere else. Just my opinion. Also, I'm not sure if you plan to use Riviera's free shuttle from the airport but the shuttle never showef up at the airport the first go around then told us when we called that a large bus would be arriving and to look out for it. A small white van showed up and there were faded words on the side so we almost missed the shuttle again. Best route fron the airport may be Uber again instead of trying to depend on The Riviera's shuttle.",0
1371,janasonia2015,Jul 2015,"Hi I'm not the hotel ( though you directed your question there). To my knowledge, there's no shuttle provided to tour the town, free or otherwise. We used taxis and walked a lot.",0
1372,Joseph T,May 2015,No fitness centre. The mandatory resort fee includes: - towels for the beach(you'll also have to pay more to the guy on beach if you want an umbrella) - happy hour. Basically free drinks from 7-8pm. Not even worth it because there's a limit of 3 drinks per person and it gets packed. - Airport shuttle. Need to book 1 day in advance - free water and plastic cups - free sour apples next to the water,1

The room over looked the alley so at night we got to hear/watch drunk people vomit outside our window 4 out of the 7 nights we spent there. Also in the early mornings the garbage trucks and delivery trucks would roar down the alley. Talked to the front desk about it and they looked at me like I was from mars. I am sure I couldn't possibly be the only one that has had this issue. Of course we got the standard response that "" we are sorry to hear that"" what they really meant was we could care less and are not going to do anything about it as they looked at there watch like is my shift over with yet...

As for noise, we were there for three days leading up to New Year's Eve and Ocean drive was incredibly busy and crazy (but that's why one stays in South Beach!!). Being a bit on the hard of hearing side (far too much Who etc at incredible volumes), I slept like a babe- didn't hear anything at all. My wife, on the other hand, did hear the music drifting up from below even thouggh we did request and receive a room on the top floor. Friends of ours who were in the next room and further from the speakers heard less noise. Since the hotel provides ear plugs, do expect some noise. Feel free to ask any other questions.",1

Actually the roof / pool area is rather fantastic...not only can you see the ocean, you can see the roof of everything around...lovely place to hang out. Noise level...not too bad. We had a room overlooking the outdoor dining area, so we were not on Collins, but, if we opened the window during the day, you could here the city. At night, nothing out of the ordinary (for me) as to noise. Normal city level. Did not disturb me at all. With the AC running (or the fan...as it was December when we were there) the ""white noise from the AC drowned out everything (except for an occasional police car). Much quieter than further north on Collins!",0

1625,TBotch,Aug 2016,"I would say no, but unsure. The Hyde pool is probably the area for topless.",0
1625,MLI87,Aug 2016,Yes they do permit it,0
1625,ONewlove,Aug 2016,Hello! I am pretty sure the beach is topless but I don't think the hotel is. I would contact them directly. Most hotels do not allow for topless sunbathing unless specifically said on the pool portion of the website or they designate an area of the pool to be topless (as seen in Vegas especially). I could be wrong. Please let us know if otherwise! Thank you!,0
1625,Jennifer D,Aug 2016,I honestly don't know but no one did that by the pool. There was one woman who was topless at the beach and I believe it was in the SLS beach area.,0
1625,Angela C,Aug 2016,Hi Jill I do not believe it is permitted at the pool area as there are families with children who stay at the hotel and use the pool. During my stay we spent most of our time on the beach and I did not see anyone go topless. Perhaps you should contact the hotel directly for further information as well as direction if there are any areas on the beach or pools that permit topless bathing. Have fun and enjoy SB Miami!,0
1626,MamaNewcanaan,Mar 2016,No no no Miame not your place for top less Anywhere,0
1626,Kathy S,Mar 2016,I don't think so. I didn't see any topless people.,0

1627,EliBKK,Mar 2016,If you're looking for the cheapest option Uber. You'll pay $50 a day once all of the fees are accounted for.,0
1627,DrBrick1956,Sep 2015,They have valet parking but don't recall the cost. For going into Miami I suggest taking a taxi (Uber). Staying in South Beach walking and taxi is fine. If you plan to get away for day driving to the keys I suggest to rent a car for a day or two. I rented once from Hertz close by while staying at the Ritz Carlton close to SLS. Enjoy your stay!,0
1627,Carlos B,Sep 2015,The hotel has valet parking and it works great. If you plan to go to other places in Miami and not only South Beach a car is always necessary. I don¬¥t know the cost per night. Enjoy!,0
1627,AlbertoMay,Sep 2015,They have valet parking at around 35 dollars per night. Do you need a car ? Where will you be going besides the beach and all the night life is in South Beach you can Uber everywhere,0

1627,Lisa M,Sep 2015,"Hi..SLS actually provides BMWs with drivers at no cost to their guests. You just need to call the front desk to reserve. They'll take you within a mile of the hotel. We used them for our dinner reservations. They do have limited parking as the hotel is a small Boutique Hotel with a circular driveway. It's lovely. When we visit, other than dinner and lots of walking & shopping on Lincoln Road, we rarely leave the hotel. We just love it! I hope this helped answer your question. If you plan on doing lots of sightseeing in Miami, I guess a car would help. There's lots of traffic on Collins Ave. We prefer to party at SLS. Have a wonderful trip!",0
1628,Michael K,Jan 2016,"Regarding the rooms: no, not at all. The parties SLS is known for are the day parties, which are generally 12-4ish. At night it's definitely active (a couple restaurants and bars), but we never had any issues with noise whatsoever. Regarding the pools: they have 2 pools, one of which hosts the day party, and one of which is for hotel guests. The pools are pretty much side by side so you are definitely going to hear the music and people even at the guest pool. Hope this helps!",1 vote

Both are gorgeous. I think the difference is the color scheme, Nobu is beige and brown carpeting and Eden is blues. I had booked Eden Rock and when we got there, reception told us that we were in Nobu Hotel and we had to go to that reception desk which is only 20 ft away. We had complementary drinks from a moving bar at 7:00 each night which was a great idea! maybe that is only for Nobu? i didn't think to ask that. The hotel, its facilities, its staff, are so welcoming and warm, they WANT to make it special. Its a superb stay. But If you are very high maintenance, like top of the spectrum, this isn't for you. You share the staff with other guests, and when they get busy you have to understand it may take a little longer than you want, but not bad at ALL.",3

During this time our beach and that of neighboring hotels and condominiums is closed but we can assure you that the beach is looking much better now. The Federal Government has advised us that the tentative open date for the beach is October 9th, however this can be impacted by the weather. We are happy to make beach accommodations for you just a few steps north from the hotel. Should you wish to do so, please let us know. Warm Regards, Oliver Malik Hotel Manager",1

1805,Robert P,Jul 2018,"Flying into Ft. Lauderdale is, in some ways, preferable to flying into MIA. The distance in terms of time to the Loews as far as driving (or Uber/Taxi) is not that much different, given traffic. There is generally less of a clog getting out of Ft. Laud. around the airport than is the case for Miami. A typical taxi fare from MIA to the Loews might range from $40 - $60, and from Ft. Laud I can't imagine it would be more than $5 to $10 above that. If you're renting a car and driving you likely wouldn't even notice much of a difference. Hope that helps!",1

1809,Andrea E,Apr 2018,"Honestly, unless you‚Äôre booking a photo shoot with a high-end magazine, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the pool cabanas. They are at least $400 / day and can go as high as $1000 on busy weekends. But the price alone is not the issue - the pool is not an adult pool. It‚Äôs FULL OF KIDS!! Why pay more for the cabana than the room to hear screeching and crying all afternoon? Okay, so maybe you have kids and you want your family in the cabana area to have shade, food service and extra towels or something. You can get all that, at the pool for free. The cabanas on the beach are better. And the service at the beach is top-notch. You might get more value at the beach area. I presume you‚Äôre looking for value if you‚Äôre asking about whether the tip is included with the cabana rental. Good Luck and Enjoy Loews Miami Beach!",0
1810,Andrea E,Apr 2018,"I am not sure if they have rooms that have never been occupied by a guest with a pet. The property was generally spotless. The cleanliness of the hotel is not an issue. I do understand that animal dander is what people can be allergic to but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be okay at this hotel with the rooms. Most dogs I saw are small - purse dogs. You barely notice them. And if you do, it‚Äôll be in the lobby. It‚Äôs chaos there, always. Worry more about being run over by a baby carriage than a purse puppy. The dogs are well-mannered - the people with 3 kids and no handle on the situation ruin the experience. :-)",1

1845,Susan M,Sep 2016,"I think it was round $10 or $15 for a chair, for sure $25 for a umbrella. But as the chairs were free as a hotelguest I didn't really look at it properly. Bananaboat $25 for 15 min and jetski $85 for 30 min.",0
1845,Mandy G,Aug 2016,"They always asked for our room number for setting up the chairs, but I know they had a deal with other hotels so they can also use the chairs. If you are staying at the hotel the chairs are free but the umbrellas were $10 each at the time.",0

1848,Michelle S,Jun 2022,"I visited back in March of this year. We did not feel it was necessary for cleaning service everyday but if you wanted something, all you had to do was ask for it and they would accommodate you. The jewel of this hotel by far was the employees working there, especially Estefan at the Concierge desk. We did not wear masks in back in March. Most of the town did not make this mandatory.",0

1871,MsMessyHG,Sep 2020,"You tip when leave the car, you tip when they bring the car back to you. If a different guy helps unload or pack the car, you tip them too. We tipped $5 each time we took the car in and out, and we tip at least $2 bag for anyone helping with those. On the last day, they had to fit in six suitcases and three carryon bags (love shopping in the US) so we gave them $20 to share. I mean, you give these guys $20, you can make their whole day. It's worth it. We live in Iceland where everything is mega expensive, so tipping like this is just part of the budget and America still seems cheap in comparison. And it makes you feel like a real a high roller for a little while. Just make it part of your spending plan and you won't mind. Oh, try to give one dollar bills to make it easier for them to share out the money.",1
1871,happyTravelingOne,Sep 2020,"I usually tip $1 per bag or $5 max on arrival if they are removing the bags from the car for me. When coming and going I usually tip $2 for retrieval of the car, but do not pay when I drop it back off. Paying in advance doesn't help anything because their shifts change all the time. As for the Cadillac Hotel, we found side street parking pretty close by and did not use valet, as I think the valet charge was $60+ per day. There was also a public parking garage option that was a short walk. We only pulled the car up to unload and load. Enjoy your travels!",1
1871,Martin S,Sep 2020,"Thanks both of you. But to tip both (arrival / departure) seems really expensive. I just read two threads where nearly every american wrote that you just have to tip at pickup. Seems it depends a little on what you feel, of course. But I think 5$ at pickup should be fair, + eventually tipping for luggage.",0

If you don‚Äôt want to spend that kind of money on breakfast, there is an excellent convenience store/cafe/bakery right across the street, and they have excellent breakfast sandwiches on freshly baked bread, donuts, bagels, etc. and you can get a great regular or Cuban coffee as well!

1886,Mel ATX,Aug 2019,"This is a great value for Miami. If you want to hang out in South Beach during the day, then you would probably prefer a hotel in South Beach.

Artsy, interesting, etc. Wynwood Bar and Grill was really good. The hotel beach was perfect, steps from the hotel.",0

If you plan on being out late and club hopping, and don‚Äôt want to worry about transportation back to your hotel 2 miles away, stay in South Beach.

We didn't care for the adult pool area because it felt very small....we preferred the family pool area which was open and spacious... so unfortunately I didn't ask the price of the cabanas there, but the hotel will definitely fill you in. I believe they are more expensive on the weekends than weekdays.",0
1903,Ruggerdoc69,Nov 2018,I have no idea. There are tons of rally comfortable lounge chairs all over the pool area. Email the hotel - they would be more than happy to tell you I'm sure!

1904,30196Cbc2012,Oct 2018,I am not sure on the view. We had a king bed with a partial oceanfront view. There was plenty of space for two. I would suggest contacting the hotel directly. They were very friendly and willing to help.,1

Collins Avenue is where all or most of the Miami Beach hotels are including the Cadillac Marriott. You can walk to South Beach or to the famous Fontainebleau Hotel and enjoy drinks in the hotel bar. Personally, we walked to the restaurants and returned back to the hotel by UBER. UBER in Miami Beach was fast, efficient and reasonably priced.",1
1909,sara78912345,Feb 2018,Yes bus stop is just few steps away from the hotel. Local transport buses pass from almost front of the hotel. Uber is reasonable and I think it is the best way to travel if the distance is not walkable,1

1910,TravelGuy045,Feb 2018,The hotel is beautiful and the people are amazing. The hotel does have a older classic part and a much new wing (which is what I would recommend) - The newer building is closer to the ocean - you are going to love it!,0

1912,TravelGuy045,Dec 2017,Lucky! Do not worry about the parking - crazy amount ($50 p/d) but they really take care with your car no worries about in and out or what hour of the day. Amazing place with so many amazing people - enjoy yourself.,1
1913,nikki D,Oct 2017,"wow that is horrible. call again front desk and demand to speak with a manager. it helps if you still have your reservation number handy so they can pull up when you stayed and the fact that you had a car with you. honestly i have never heard of this, and this is a HORRIBLE position this puts you in. also call the customer service number provided on the ticket, and explain the situation and what they recommend as well. they may give you an extension or you might have to go to the police department personally too i am so sorry",0

Its a great hotel to stay in, but if your leaving on a cruise i would suggest to stay a bit closer to the port.",1
1921,ivy11x3boyz1girl,Jun 2017,Agree with Nicole. We stayed there after our cruise it took us 25 minutes by UBER with a charge of $15.57 for 2 of us. We stayed at the Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay property before we left.,0

1925,kim d,Mar 2017,"I don't know if they have a honeymoon package, but I do know that if you book through a third party, it usually takes quite a while for the money to come out. Because of that, the hotel usually won't answer questions or change packages for you. I've dealt with sites like cheap tickets,etc and in those cases the airlines/hotel aren't making a full profit and aren't responsible for errors in scheduling! That really stinks and its far and few between, however, thats what they do. When I booked the hotel straight through the hotel, they took the money out right then. So be patient, it could take some time. Enjoy your honeymoon-CONGRATS.",2
1926,AJP57,Mar 2017,"This kind of info is typically always listed on your hotel's website. They reflect a valet parking cost of $39 plus taxes, per day. If you're driving around in Miami Beach, public parking is problematical and not cheap. A great way to get around is Uber. I always use public transportation when I'm there including taking an express bus from the airport to Miami Beach for about $2.35. It's bus #150 and leaves about every 20 minutes from the airport. You have to take the MIA Mover from the airport to the Transportation Center where the rental cars, Metro, Tri-Rail and bus connections are. You get to the MIA Mover from Concourse E but you'll see signs directing you there throughout the airport. You'll need to have exact change for the bus or purchase an EasyCard at the bus terminal in the Transportation Center. There are attendants there to help you use the EasyCard vending machines that accept cash or credit cards. EasyCards give you free transfers between buses so that you don't have to pay again within a specified time period for a transfer to another bus. Unfortunately, you can't reload the EasyCard on the buses so you'll need to load enough for your entire stay. There are two kinds of EasyCards, a regular one and a temporary one. I have the regular one that you can reload online since I travel there a few times a year. Go to the Miami-Dade Transit website to read more about their system. Bus #150 also has luggage racks. The ride from the airport to your hotel is less than 30 mins. & you'd get off at 41st Street and Indian Head Highway. You'd walk two short blocks to your hotel (take 40th St. & walk to Collins Ave.). The hotel is on a major street, Collins Ave., where you can take the bus to Bal Harbour Shops (upscale mall with Neiman Marcus and Saks 5th Ave. as anchor stores) or to Aventura Mall (very large/beautiful and is the 5th highest grossing mall in the U.S.). In front of the hotel, you'd catch the ""S"" bus to Bal Harbour Shops located at 97th St. & Collins Ave.; this bus will also take you to Aventura Mall which is about a 40 minute bus ride from your hotel and is also the end of the route. Bus #120 is the faster bus to take to these two destinations because it has limited stops however, you have to take the one marked Aventura Mall since they have one that ends at Haulover Beach. Easy bus stop has the routes posted on it that serve that stop so you may have to walk a block or so to a stop served by both the ""S"" and ""120"" bus then you can take the first one that comes by. Again, the ""S"" bus stops at every stop along its route but the ""120"" doesn't since it is faster and has limited stops. Safe travels!",2
1927,Jonny L,Mar 2017,"Ft. Lauderdale was not allowing users at the airport unless that changed from a month ago. You can take an uber to the airport though.

Unlike the Cadillac tower in the Ocean tower you do get a ocean view room with a guaranteed balcony. Also, it is our newest tower so the rooms are more modern. Although we do have ocean view in the Cadillac Tower there are partial as in a 90 degree angle view. Some rooms are not consider ocean view but king size overlooking the city, those are the rooms with the ocean tower in front but partial view as well. Therefore, if you book a king overlooking the city and request a view and we have one of those partial available we may place you in one of those rooms. Never the less, you are looking at the ocean in both tower, it all depends whether you want to pay more for a much better view.",0

Being cautious and having common sense helps a lot, like not walking along the beach at 2:00 am, or flashing monies or valuables around.

1937,biggirl2016,Dec 2016,"This area is indeed safe. It is a teensy bit north of South Beach and is called Mid-Beach. There is also a North Beach. It is all Miami Beach however. The restaurants in North Beach were less expensive. You can find Pizza Hut, IHOP and Dennys in North Beach. South Beach AND North Beach can be a little sketchy. Don't visit the beach at night and check out Freebee Miami. You can download their app and request free rides from the hotel and back. You can even flag them down in South Beach. They look similar to golf carts almost with a ton of advertising on them. Just don't forget to tip. If you do a quick Google search of Miami Beach crime that may help.

Also, downtown South Beach has nice boutiques as well. If you are not using an uber or lyft a cab would run you about $15 each way, uber about $7. If you wanted to explore downtown Miami I would try coco Walk shopping center by the grove or shoppes at Mayfair in the Grove. Awesome shops and great restaurants.

We walked around 1/2 block to the beach(either past the Raleigh which was closer to chairs and umbrellas or between SLS and THE DELANO)...almost the same distance from walking through the back of Marseilles if it were open.,0

Podiamos elegir 3 ingredientes dentro de una lista, pero hab√≠a otras opciones. Nosotros desayunamos un bowl con fruta fresca, luego tostadas o un bagel tostado con queso de untar y mermelada, acompa√±ado de cafe, o te o cortado sin limite. En cuanto a malls, sobre la calle peatonal Lincoln Road, hay muchisimos locales de ropa y otros articulos asi como tambi√©n un local de Maicy¬¥s pr√≥ximo . De lo contrario hay que tomar un taxi y el shopping m√°s proximo es el Dolphin Mall, muy bueno!! Est√° pasando el aeropuerto. Un poco m√°s lejos est√° el famoso outlet Sawgrass y hay que averig√ºar porque ellos tienen un omnibus que pasa a buscar a los huespedes por los hoteles y los traslado de regreso al hotel. Comer hoy en Miami depende mucho del lugar. Hay locales CVS y Walgreen¬¥s que venden comida o para micro o sanwiches deliciosos asi como diversidad de bebidas a bajo costo. Almorzar o cenar puede ir desde U$30 a U$60. Frente al Hotel Marseilles est√° Maxine¬¥s Bar y Bistr√≥, muy bueno, donde comer un plato cada uno o incluso compartido con una peque√±a entrada, mas bebida cuesta alrededor de U$37.

En cuanto a ir al Sawgrass el hotel no dispone del traslado. Si hay una representante de una agencia que te contrata el servicio, con un costo por pasajero y horario de salida y regreso predeterminado. Va pasando por diferentes hoteles, lo comento para calcular el tiempo de aprovechamiento del paseo de compras -el lugar es enorme y alejado-.- Si es un grupo opino que conviene un taxi, contratado desde el hotel para que no te paseen y cobren demasiado.

Two room types that do not have a balcony are our amazing Atrium and city view rooms both room types have beautiful floor to ceiling windows. The biggest difference between the two room types is their location and where they face. For Example the Atrium is a more quiet room type facing the inner part of our building that has a internal turf and plant area. The city view faces different parts of our convenient intersections of either Alton and 17th street or Alton and Dade blvd. Hope this helps. Hotel Representative,0

We paid a LOT of $$$$$ to be 8th floor Oceanfront room and we were SO disappointed. All the oceanfront rooms overlook a parking lot and the roof of a restaurant which has an extremely loud industrial air conditioning unit running 24/7 so if you do go out on the balcony, you can't ever hear each other talk because it is soooo loud. We spent about 2 minutes on our balcony because it was incredibly loud. The rooms are beautiful but I would never pay $$$$$ again for this hotel since it does not live up to the view it claims! LOTS of other hotels along here have MUCH better viewsand are closer to the ocean.",0

2047,Lana_NY_2017,Jul 2019,"I have never had that experience with the beach chairs and lost stuff. I have visited Nobu 3 summers (last visit was in the end of June 2019). I left my stuff every morning on my beach chair and had a long walk along the beach, when I returned my stuff always was there, nobody never even touched. I can't say anything about pool lounges as I tried to enjoy the ocean as much as I could but I think it should be the same situation. Nobu and Eden Roc share same beach spot and same pool areas and are very respectful hotels with hight reputation. People who work there are very committed and reliable. I would recommend you to keep your valuables with you if you want to leave the chair for a long time and let know people who work around that you are going to be back and you should not have any problem with that. A small tip- if you want to get the best spot on the beach or at the pool -you should come early in the morning, I would say around 9 and you will get the chair you want ;-) Hope it helps!",1
2047,Krlieb,Jul 2019,"I know you need to claim your chairs early- whether it‚Äôs beachside or poolside- this is the case whether you stay at Nobu, the Edition, the Fountainbleu or any hotel on the beach. Typically if you leave the chairs to go in the pool, make sure you have some sandals, a bag without valuables, or something to indicate you are coming back. It‚Äôs good to let someone nearby know you are coming back too. I do not have any experience leaving the chairs and having my items put in lost and found. This could be the case perhaps if you left your items and never returned to the chairs.",1

2057,LNS4,Aug 2018,"Although Lowes, is a great hotel, Eden Roc is like a docked cruise ship. The balcony views are beautiful, the proximity to the beach is steps away, the pools are lovely and with exception of the spa guests or a few that have purchased pool memberships the pools are exclusive to hotel guests. They are watching, there are pool attendants who greet you and escort you to your pool lounger and place your towel. In addition the beach has attendants with full service including beach chairs and towels. You never have to leave because the dining are bars are the best in Miami. Concierge can have anything brought to the hotel you need to make your stay special. The only thing to avoid is Starbucks, it is the worst ever. But no need to use it because Malibu is so much better. Enjoy!",0

Malibu farms is an easy few steps away as well as the public bathroom since you will be 7 months pregnant. You will not walk yourself too much at this hotel. You never have to leave the property to enjoy a great meal and mocktail/health drinks. They have a wonderful spa on-site for you and a package for couples. I love the hot stone messages.",1
2058,Eric G,Jul 2018,"Nobu hotel is definitely the right place. There are little to no children around and the pool/beach scene is very relaxed and not party-like. As for eating well, a restaurant called Malibu Farm is located on the property and it serves delicious, healthy meals.",1
2058,Maggie Sherman,Jul 2018,"Any of the Miami Beach hotels will be crowded but may not be as hectic during summer as during prime season. Not surprisingly, the smaller properties are less crowded than the larger ones. The lower pool at Nobu is less crowded but that does not mean that it is not crowded. In season, you need to get there early to get a choice lounge position or you are seated near the pool on a ""grass"" area. There are really no good dinner options within walking distance of the hotel...so, as long as you must cab, I would suggest going to South Beach for dinners - the restaurants are far superior to anything close to Nobu. I personally prefer South Beach for the convenience and proximity of good dining and usually stay in that part of Miami.",1

The outdoor seating is beautiful, service attentive and everything from the drinks to the food are note worthy. You do not have to leave if you do not want to leave between the two places. Concierge can also help you with other options including food to-go sent to the hotel. Miami is a great place for foodies so if you feel like venturing out check out tripadvisor for great options.",0
2060,KYandHy,Jun 2018,It was beyond gorgeous BUT expensive!! My friend and i were in shock to be charged 18% on top of everything all around Miami. So make note of that before you tip! Our drinks and burger at the hotel were yummy but again expensive. I think my burger and drink was over $40. Make sure you go to beach early to reserve a good spot - the only lame thing about the beach area is 1) the close w the slightest small storm 2) the close up at 6. Pretty lame when it sure would be nice to sit there and enjoy the sunset etc,0

There‚Äôs many comfy, semi-private places to hang out there, not to mention the phenomenal lounge setting at the bar. You can chill on the gorgeous property and someone is right there to meet your needs. For 3-4 days, it‚Äôs worth it. Plus you can use the spa as an all- inclusive.

2168,aubie1999,Apr 2018,They do. It started recently as of April 2018. Great service and unheard of in this type of location. Great place,1
2168,Nancy H,Mar 2018,Sorry I can‚Äôt help you with this. Perhaps call hotel directly.,-1

2171,Nancy H,Jan 2018,Let me give you a heads up- the beachfront is almost non existent right now unfortunately due to hurricane damage- so if you are looking for a quiet beachfront vacation with toddlers - this wouldn‚Äôt be right for you at all. However- this hotel helped me relocate to another Hilton- the Hilton Doubletree - in Sunny Isles and that was perfect true relaxing Miami Beach area with lovely pool as well. It is also on Collins Ave. Hope this helps!,1

2179,Shannon B,Aug 2017,You are given 2 chairs with towels each day at the beach. You can purchase an umbrella for $20 a day or the cabana is $60 a day. We only used the umbrella. The cabana attendants were great about adjusting the umbrella throughout the day.,0

2184,Megan C,Jul 2017,Yes! The front desk gave my 3 1/2 yr old daughter a cute little beach bag upon arrival. The staff at the beach got to know her and were so friendly. They provided sand castle making toys on the beach and were great about getting us close to the water so we could play on the beach with her.,1
2184,paulalienlyfe,Jul 2017,Yes it is they'll enjoy the pool and go to the beach also there's lots of other fun stuff to do near by,1
2184,Charles A,Jul 2017,"I mean yes, I think it is. They have multiple pools there and it seems to be great for families.. A lot of families were there on my visit.. They don't have kid activities there though if that is what you are looking for, however they do have a concierge that can set up all kinds of tours and/or other trips and activities for you to do with discounts...",1
2184,Preeti S,Jul 2017,yes I have 9 and 12 year old and they enjoyed this hotel if you can get close to pool on 4th floor thats fun,1

2187,Joyce jacobson,Dec 2018,I find them very hard to get on the phone for help. Liked it in 2017. They were very inattentive and unhelpful in 3/2018. Downgraded my room from what I reserved!,0

2187,mpogiorno,May 2017,Do not stay in this hotel - they have bedbugs & cakroches.,-1
2188,Steve K,Mar 2017,"We have found the buffet breakfast to be great. Eggs, bacon, chicken sausage, bread, bagels, jams, oatmeal, cereals, fruit -solid selection of fruit and melons. In addition, if you want an egg prepared a certain way, like an omelet - they handle it in the kitchen for you. In terms of the in-house restaurant - we have had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant and out by the bar -same kitchen handling - the food is very good. Hotel prices, but that is to be expected. I have only done dinner one time as a take out to my room, while there on business. It was a salad with quinoa and chicken etc. it was great. I do have relatively high standards for my food.",2
2188,Globalme133,Mar 2017,I too am a Hilton honours member so breakfast was included Omelettes are cooked to order from the kitchen The restaurant was quiet for lunch and dinner many people ordered food to the beach and pool and bar area We did not as we found it expensive and had enjoyed a big breakfast and preferred to explore the area for dinner,1
2188,KirkwoodMissouri,Mar 2017,Had only the buffet breakfast and it was everything you'd expect was happy with it . Other meals I couldn't speak for. Email hotel for restaurant menu.,0
2188,Daddyboy00,Mar 2017,I'm a Hilton Honors member so my breakfast was included in my room charge. It is a full buffet. Many choices. Very good quality. I did it eat at the restaurant inside the hotel. We did order lunch in the beach. Casual menu. Good food. I don't know where to find a menu. Call the hotel. It is very kid friendly. A pool and hot tub outside with nice amenities. And of course the beach. Many children on the property when we visited. Hotel is away from the craziness of South Beach. I would recommend if you have stayed at Hiltons and like the way they operate. Nothing bad here,0
2188,jamesjQ7894IT,Mar 2017,"I am a Hilton Diamond member so the breakfast was free. The restaurant looked fairly busy but typical hotel food, nothing special. Lots of kids there in the pools and on the beach. One of the valet told me there is a public parking lot or structure about two blocks away from the hotel that is cheaper than the $40 per day valet parking.",0
2188,Lucienneh,Mar 2017,"The buffet was small in comparison to others that I have gone to. It was the typical buffet offering. There was no omelet bar but there were other egg choices and the typical meats and potatoes. There was yogurt,granola and cereal as well as a mix of fruit. I do not know the cost of the buffet, I wasn't paying so I can't comment on the cost. The restaurant door was very foo we had lunch there and dinner another night. There were 4 of us and we all had something different and we all enjoyed what we oreserd. There isn't much for kids at the hotel, other than the beach right outside the property and the pool. But then again South Beach isn't made for kids. I know this isn't much information, but I hope it helps",0
2190,HLICguy,Feb 2017,We used Uber for everything,2
2190,Wasif Z,Feb 2017,This is the best option cause you pay this flat fee for the whole day and keep coming in going out as you please and valet will be there to help you l. Otherwise you have to use public parking which could be $30ish but you still gotta walk a bit in the heat. Rather pay the extra $10 in my opinion for convenience,0
2190,Paul H,Feb 2017,"uber, lyft, free shuttle",0
2191,chrisspeicher,Feb 2017,Total rip off. They get your car and take it to the public lot a few blocks away. Parking there is $18 per day. Park there.,2
2192,ANN Z S,Feb 2017,There is a lot a few blocks away on Collins by the public beach which is $1 per hour from 8 to 6 you can pay on your phone or at the meter. Its hit or miss but better than the hotel price. After 6 its free.,0

2197,Harry1371,Jan 2017,I think it's like a deposit till u stay for any incidental. Still ask the hotel managers,0
2197,Philip C,Jan 2017,The only fee I had was the resort fee. Parking is expensive in all Miami Beach Hotels. I always UBER it when there. Uber is very inexpensive and much more convenient. Hotel was very accommodating with anything we needed.,0
2197,307freddyb,Jan 2017,Is not 100 buck imposed fee. the thing they charge 25 buck for Internet (into the resort fee) and they said is free and 40 buck more for parking (don't say anything anywhere) and 30 buck early check in (because I was 2 hours early).,0
2197,Lo B,Jan 2017,"Like the prior above answer; Call the Hotel and ask Them directly to disclose the fees, It could vary from parking to beach chairs or free internet, gym facilities etc... Any way the word "" Imposed "" usually doesn't means anything Good.",0
2197,MARCIA W,Jan 2017,Hotel Cabana is Not worth it at all very bad hotel it's no better then a $60 room.,0

2204,lindtlady,Sep 2016,Balcony facing the ocean is the best rooms. Order a coconut at the bar,0
2204,Renee Q,Sep 2016,Make sure you have a room with the full ocean view. As a heads up- some of the balconies are not very private and you can see right into others balconies. Reserve a full cabana on the beach early as they go quickly.,0
2205,Ikhine,Sep 2016,There was no music while i was there.,0

2207,JHDE21,Jul 2016,"It is not a secure parking lot. I saw valets running back from several blocks away from hotel. Parking in the area is extremely limited. If you opt for the valet service, be sure to allow extra time when retrieving vehicle, one of the slowest valet services I've ever experienced.",0
2207,Mona K,Jul 2016,They do not have a secure parking . Parking is at a premium and no street parking is close to the hotel. For your peace of mind and accessibility to the vehicle I would opt for the hotel provided Valet parking .,0
2207,Manny R,Jul 2016,"No. They use an open-air municipal-like parking lot as valet parking. No different than off-street parking. That said, parking is a premium in this area and enforcement is ruthless. Pay the valet and avoid getting a parking citation. But just to be clear, they don't have a secure garage facility not do they have dedicated security for their valet parking area.",0
2208,AUSTLON,Jul 2016,No they don't. I had to have a huge argument to keep room longer. They keep your luggage that's it. If you want to change use the toilets. I guess you can shower by the pool. With European flights leaving in evening it's nice to be able to shower before get on plane.,1
2208,Renee Q,Jul 2016,"Yes, there is a room where they will store your luggage and there are bathrooms on the main level where you can change.",0

2246,BobbyTs,Nov 2016,The first couple of floors definitely do not. I viewed the pool and party from the roof top party. Not sure about top floors but my guess is no because the roof top can get pretty wild and could see many things going over the side onto a balcony. Good luck,0

2260,David L,Jan 2015,Greetings Brittany. Most hotels in Miami Beach do not have microwave and fridges. Clevelander and Essex House do provide a refrigerator on request. Most hotels have strict limit policies due to fire codes. You can probably get the 2 beds in the room and call up to speak to the Revenue Manager and I am sure they will just quote you an extra person cost. I would suggest the Essex House as they have beds with two doubles in them and you get continental breakfast with it!! David Lopez,0
2260,willnas,Aug 2015,Is the Clevelander rooms really that small and will you have fun time staying,0
2261,David L,Jan 2015,You would be safe at the Clevelander as elevators are secured via room key card. If you are looking for a slightly quieter space we have our sister property called Essex House by Clevelander. You will received complimentary continental breakfast for 2 at Essex House. Please call us at 877 532 4006.,0

2262,TravelAgentDiary,Dec 2014,"There's a fun spot very close (about 5 min walking) called Mango's. It is a nice little lounge/club. They mostly play reggaeton/latino/hip hop music so not sure if that's your thing but it was a fairly inexpensive place to go out for the night. For G29er's response, I cannot make a suggestion for 'red' as I have never eaten there; however, I did eat at Prime 112 and while it was delicious it was not inexpensive at all. Also note that The Clevelander itself is a fun nightlife spot. I'm not sure about Sunday night (we were there Thursday night of Labor Day Weekend) but the pool party was live, bartenders were great, and no cover charge since you are staying there!",1
2262,G29er,Dec 2014,"If your staying at the clevlander finding places to eat/party is as easy as walking down the street (right or left) the hotel is surrounded with curb side food and bar spots I suggest u make it a point to get a popover at the Betsy for breakfast they are amazing also yardbird and ontentic are very good and well price but if u wanna spend alittle go to the meat market the Moscow mule was perfect also many of the locals suggest ""red"" over prime 112 for steak",1
2262,Mike S,Jan 2015,You must take a cab to little havana. Versailles restaurant. Quite amazing. Anything off the beach will be considerably less expensive. We went to the versace house for dinner. 300 bucks. It was worth it :),0

Since my group was a party of nine, I was looking for a company that could offer private pick-up and transfer at a fair price. I called MyTravels & Tours Corp. (also featured here on TripAdvisor) and spoke to Dianela. She gave me a great deal on a mini-bus just for our group. When I booked the transfers she asked for all our flight information and the driver texted me as soon as we arrived. There was no wait and the vehicle was clean and comfortable. The departure pick-up was just as smooth. I highly recommend them.",0

There's also a city lot next door, with probably the same parameters.

2882,Marco A,Dec 2014,"It has been exactly like that, unfortunately. I appreciate that the management has answered, but it would have been better if they faced the things on time during the stay. Example: It was stressing arriving in the evening and to ask day by day to have the towels replaced. The problem was that they moved all the towels even not laying on the floor (so not to be replaced) and leaving just one shower towel or one face towel. What sense???",0

2964,Brittany J,Nov 2015,"Rex8888- Thank you for taking the time to leave a comment on W South Beach. I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you are not pleased with the responses to not so favorable reviews. Our Marketing team handles guest reviews and as we are not involved in operations we respond in a way to not offend our guests or make assumptions. Many people on TripAdvisor have usernames that makes it difficult to identify who they are so, in turn, it can become difficult to try and resolve issues. We want to make sure our guests know we care about them, appreciate their feedback, and are willing to do what it takes to turn around any bad experiences. There have been instances of guests who left the hotel without reporting an issue, left negative reviews and due to the opportunity to connect with management, we were able to rectify the issue. In fact, there are positive reviews of the hotel that candidly talks about negative experiences during a stay but because of how the situation was handled by the team with genuine care, personalized service and undivided attention the issue was overshadowed by the resolution and action taken. We are all very committed to providing the best service to our guests and management does a great job at resolving guest opportunities. We hope you reconsider giving W another try. Kind Regards, Brittany Jarrin Marketing Coordinator",0

Trip Advisor has some good pictures of the Savoy courtyard.",1
3016,Ayse T,Feb 2017,The courtyard is made up of a breakfast terrace and the pool. The hotel is made up of 2 buildings that face each other with the pool in the middle so your room will be faced towards the other building but you will have a small terrace with the view to the ocean.,1

In any case they will ask for your creditcard in case you order drinks at the beach/pool and charge your room, or you pick something from the Mini -Bar or like the bathrobe.... In any case they are fair and Miami South Beach is not the cheapest spot at all. Enjoy your stay",0

3041,Acworld,Apr 2015,I am sure the hotel staff can advise. Most hotels are accessible and I have seen large wheeled chairs used on beaches. As well pools have lifts. You may need to arrange for transfer from the airport in advance. Restaurants are outdoor patio style so should be easy! Be sure to go down to watch the cruise ships leave as you can manage easily on the sidewalk.

I was there in April and courtyard pool was deathly quiet (think I saw a couple of older people there once in 4 days) and the rooftop pool was busier but never packed and always possible to get sun loungers, even over a weekend. The beach is across the road, maybe a 5 min walk for the able bodied but plenty of loungers and umbrellas all included in your resort fee. So plenty of options for you and your mum to sun bathe.

There was no one in the pool at that time of day so I can't say if it is a better choice than the beach. The weather was perfect so I assume everyone was across the street at the beach.

3258,Becky A,Jun 2019,"When I stayed at this hotel there were just couples. The rooftop pool is more like a plunge pool than a swimming pool as it is very shallow but there was a very relaxed and peaceful atmosphere around the pool, it's a great place to chill and listen to the soothing music whilst reading a book. I did see one family with a few younger children who used the pool but they didn't stay for long.",0
3258,Les W,Jun 2019,"Hi, Its a very well appointed hotel and a very clean hotel. It is a wonderful resort for all ages and is right in the middle of South Beach! The hotel staff is awesome and they are there to provide you with information for everything that you want from South Beach and Miami - just ask! The Ocean Drive night life is one block away and the beach is right there also. The hotel includes beach chairs with your stay. There is a decent size rooftop pool (not Olympic) with a bar and they have food service from the on-site Mexican restaurant. Have Fun!",0
3258,urbanangel,Jun 2019,Dreams is very well located in South beach. Whilst I was there the cliental was of a younger age. The hotel boasts a great pool area on the roof which attracts not only its hotel guest but also non residents. I would not have any hesitation in recommending the hotel. The staff were very helpful and polite. As they have a concierge on duty any trips can be booked with ease through this agent. Also on a plus side there are a great number of restaurants attracting younger customers which are very close to this hotel.,0
3258,Marc,Jun 2019,"Hi! Even though the majority of the guests were between the ages of 20-35 and were mostly couples in the days that we were there, Dream South Beach and its guests seem to be very welcoming of all people including parents with children. But, in the end it is not really a ‚Äúfamily with children-oriented‚Äù type of hotel.. meaning that they don‚Äôt run their hotel or market themselves to attract especially that target group. Teenagers and their parents will find their way very well in Dream South Beach hotel I think :)",0

If you are after rest and relaxation, then it's a good choice, particularly if your plan is to chill out on the beach and use the spa and fitness facilities. It's true that it's away from the thick of the action on South Beach where there are loads of restaurants (but to be honest, they felt a little touristy, hustling for business) but you can get down there easily by bus which takes about 15 minutes, but it might be more in peak times (the bus stop for the return from South Beach is right outside the hotel). If you plan to eat out, then you will probably have to make more of an effort to find somewhere to eat than if you were on South Beach.

Staff however is really very nice.",0
3555,HonestChap17,Feb 2018,Romantic in the outdoor area. The staff very nice at either of the 3 areas. My opinion. There is a rooftop bar a block down with more of a fun factor if your looking for music.,0

I'm pretty sure only the suites get the ocean view. If I were you, I'd spring for the suite if one is available, the ocean view really is great albeit partially obstructed by the palm trees. Also, there is definitely more space to move around in the suite as most of the regular double rooms are only large enough to sleep and shower. If you do stay in a double room, ask for one on a higher floor (3 or 4) since they're bigger. The breakfast is free, and there is a specific menu you can choose items from. As far as parking is concerned, they do sometimes have deals that include valet parking. It's worth it to sign up for the email deals and just cancel it later, I had a free parking deal the first time I stayed there 2 years ago. Otherwise it's $20 USD daily, which still is pretty good for the location in the middle of South Beach. I'm not sure about the balloons and cake, you'd have to contact the hotel directly.

3837,callmaniac,Oct 2016,Koala There were no shades in our cabana room. There were baton drawn draperies on two separate tracks. The drapery closest to the window was sheer fabric and the second drapery was a fabric with a black out liner on the back. My guess is that the tracks are Kirsch Architrac. If you were in a tower room then perhaps there were actually shades in those windows. You can get the same effect with a sheer roller shade in the back and a roman shade with blackout fabric in the front but my guess is that they were custom made for the hotel by a workroom in Miami. I would try calling the hotel and ask Natalya. If she doesn't know she will attempt to get the details for you.,1 vote

3857,Alma B,Feb 2015,"DSM14, There are many, many options around Lincoln Rd to Dine in or just a a coffee or a drink. I would start with my favorite Pizza Place in Miami, Pizza Rustica. It;s very casual, but with the outside seating option (perfect for Lincoln Rd) and being the BEST PIZZA in Miami, it's great for lunch or casual dinners. For brunch on weekends definitely Segafredo Lincoln Road l‚ÄôOriginale. For a more upscale dining experience, my favorite three are Quattro Gastronomia Italiana, Meat Market and Sushisamba. Nightlife around Lincoln Rd.... well... SET is a great option, Haven Lounge; and to add the Latino style, Yuca is an acceptable option. At the end, remember you will be in Miami Beach. All around the place is about having fun. Walk around, don't stay just at The Mall. Enjoy your trip.",1

3929,SteveNOLA,May 2017,"IN reference to my answer, I stayed at Urbana in South Beach in February 2017. Although you can find fancier hotels, You will pay a lot more for them. For the price charged, Urbana is a good value for the money. Also their breakfast is cooked to order and was good, in my opinion. I plan on staying their again on my next visit to Miami and/or S. Beach.",0
3929,SteveNOLA,May 2017,"As stated by other respondents, there is a resort fee, which includes chairs and towels at the beach and is among the lowest of any S. Beach hotel. There is a parking fee of $30/day for valet parking which includes unlimited in & out's (there is no self park option). The parking fee is very reasonable since all of the other Hotels in or near South Beach charge $42/day. The only other parking option is to use a city owned parking garages & lots since street parking is at a premium. The City's fees are somewhat less than Urbana's valet parking fees, but you do not have in & out privileges. If your vacation plans keep you in Miami Beach or nearby downtown Miami during your say, you probably better off using Uber and not renting a car. You avoid a lot of parking fees which in aggregate are more than of a rental car. Uber does have pickup and drop-off privileges at Miami's Airport.",0

I am sure I couldn't possibly be the only one that has had this issue.

Being a bit on the hard of hearing side (far too much Who etc at incredible volumes), I slept like a babe- didn't hear anything at all. My wife, on the other hand, did hear the music drifting up from below even thouggh we did request and receive a room on the top floor. Friends of ours who were in the next room and further from the speakers heard less noise. Since the hotel provides ear plugs, do expect some noise. Feel free to ask any other questions.",1

We had a room overlooking the outdoor dining area, so we were not on Collins, but, if we opened the window during the day, you could here the city. At night, nothing out of the ordinary (for me) as to noise. Normal city level. Did not disturb me at all.

Also in the early mornings the garbage trucks and delivery trucks would roar down the alley. Talked to the front desk about it and they looked at me like I was from mars. I am sure I couldn't possibly be the only one that has had this issue.

As for noise, we were there for three days leading up to New Year's Eve and Ocean drive was incredibly busy and crazy (but that's why one stays in South Beach!!). Being a bit on the hard of hearing side (far too much Who etc at incredible volumes), I slept like a babe- didn't hear anything at all. My wife, on the other hand, did hear the music drifting up from below even thouggh we did request and receive a room on the top floor. Friends of ours who were in the next room and further from the speakers heard less noise. Since the hotel provides ear plugs, do expect some noise. Feel free to ask any other questions.",1

Actually the roof / pool area is rather fantastic...not only can you see the ocean, you can see the roof of everything around...lovely place to hang out. Noise level...not too bad. We had a room overlooking the outdoor dining area, so we were not on Collins, but, if we opened the window during the day, you could here the city. At night, nothing out of the ordinary (for me) as to noise. Normal city level. Did not disturb me at all. With the AC running (or the fan...as it was December when we were there) the ""white noise from the AC drowned out everything (except for an occasional police car). Much quieter than further north on Collins!",0

Podiamos elegir 3 ingredientes dentro de una lista, pero hab√≠a otras opciones. Nosotros desayunamos un bowl con fruta fresca, luego tostadas o un bagel tostado con queso de untar y mermelada, acompa√±ado de cafe, o te o cortado sin limite. En cuanto a malls, sobre la calle peatonal Lincoln Road, hay muchisimos locales de ropa y otros articulos asi como tambi√©n un local de Maicy¬¥s pr√≥ximo . De lo contrario hay que tomar un taxi y el shopping m√°s proximo es el Dolphin Mall, muy bueno!! Est√° pasando el aeropuerto. Un poco m√°s lejos est√° el famoso outlet Sawgrass y hay que averig√ºar porque ellos tienen un omnibus que pasa a buscar a los huespedes por los hoteles y los traslado de regreso al hotel. Comer hoy en Miami depende mucho del lugar. Hay locales CVS y Walgreen¬¥s que venden comida o para micro o sanwiches deliciosos asi como diversidad de bebidas a bajo costo. Almorzar o cenar puede ir desde U$30 a U$60. Frente al Hotel Marseilles est√° Maxine¬¥s Bar y Bistr√≥, muy bueno, donde comer un plato cada uno o incluso compartido con una peque√±a entrada, mas bebida cuesta alrededor de U$37.

En cuanto a ir al Sawgrass el hotel no dispone del traslado. Si hay una representante de una agencia que te contrata el servicio, con un costo por pasajero y horario de salida y regreso predeterminado. Va pasando por diferentes hoteles, lo comento para calcular el tiempo de aprovechamiento del paseo de compras -el lugar es enorme y alejado-.- Si es un grupo opino que conviene un taxi, contratado desde el hotel para que no te paseen y cobren demasiado. As√≠ hicimos nosotros que fuimos tres, con el mismo conductor acordamos el regreso llamandolo al celular cuando quisimos volver. Todo sali√≥ Ok. en nuestro caso fuimos al Dolphin un poco mas cerca y lleno de tiendas. Espero te ayude mi comentario. Mariale",1

4363,DoIt4Gifts 4,Jun 2016,"Hi traveler, let me answer your question its complementary breakfast only, no lunch or dinner. They cook in the Freehand, from experience I wouldn't eat at the Freehand. They're restaurants around one block away from the hostel. I cook myself I be at the beach with empanadas, water and coconuts (imported from Dominican Republic). Electrolytes from the coconuts for faster regeneration and recuperation. Good health keepings,empanadas all natural no msg hormonal drugs chicken. Dipped and fried only with olive oil. Water for the best natural form to stay hydrated in sunny side miami beach florida. In the bikini hostel area ask for DoIt4Gifts@gmail and for your empanadas, coconuts and more. Thank you, hope this answer was useful (hope I'm not to late, if so. Hope it's not the last time spent in miami florida, my message can be useful for future reference and travels as well)",1

4363,Tamara D,Jul 2016,Nope.,0
4363,vandapereira110,Jun 2016,"yes, breakfast is included. for lunch and dinner, which is not included, i suggest that if you want to save some money, you go to the supermarket 5 minutes from the Freehand and there' aslo a great diner next to this supermarket with amazing well served meals for a good price ;-) and there are other possibilities near by! if yuo are a big spender, go to the wonderful restaurant next to the freehand... the food is AMAZING there! :-D and also the bar is really cool and has other possibilities. enjoy",0

We are unfortunately unable to accommodate a minor into shared accommodations but please feel free to reach out to the agent through whom you booked to upgrade to a Private Quad as this would definitely be the optimal choice for your family. Don't be shy if we can help with anything further! Reservations",0

As my dear friend Michael R. said it is place where locals hang out and interact with our guests. Rest assure that you have made the right choice. Please ask for me at check in and i will make sure that you have the best time ever. Cheers, looking forward to meeting you ladies. Glenn Valencia General Manager freehand miami",1

4372,FreehandManagement,Dec 2014,"Hi Jenny, Thanks for your interest! You can certainly stay at the Freehand with a child. Just be sure to reserve a Private room (Standard King/Bungalow/Private Quad). Let us know if you have any other questions!",0
4372,ByeByeBlues7,Oct 2014,"Hi there, It's definitely a backpacker environment with garden/pool parties at the weekends but in all honesty they are not at all wild. I actually thought they were more than civilized. ..And during daytime the garden/pool area is very quiet and pleasant with only an handful of people there so you could easily go there and read for example. You could get a room all to yourselves rather than the shared ones. I was in a shared one facing the road and it was totally quiet even at week end nights. So the answer is YES if you are a relaxed couple not minding backpackers and some easy/quiet parties; NO if you are on the much more conservative side of things. Have a good time!",0
4372,Simi O,Oct 2014,You could ask for a non-sharing room but i don't know if they have kettles or fridges in any room. You may have to rely on the kitchen for hot water etc.,0
4372,superstellina00,Oct 2014,"Hi! I think all the above answers are correct, it really depends on you guys. As they mentioned there is a bar by the pool with some cocktail parties going on, or meeting up events which can be very late at night as well. Nothing crazy though. It is really up to you and your child, for exampple my niece is 14 months old and she sleeps everywhere and with any kind of noise :)",0
4372,K V,Oct 2014,"I think you will be fine, but recommend a room where you do not have to share and of course away from the bar area. Otherwise the lobby area is big enough and the outside area you will need to watch the pool, but with a child at 13 months, you watch them non stop anyway. Kitchen was OK with enough equipment and space to make food so that part of it is for sure covered, but as others mention, it is for sure back packer orientated but again I see no issue with this.",0
4372,Ernst_1337,Oct 2014,"Hi, I would not go there with such a young child. The reason for that is the cocktail partys at the evening in the courtyard. I really liked freehand so I don't want to be negative, but I would not go there with a baby. Regards",0
4372,Gilia Grice,Oct 2014,"I would say it's definitely more of a backpacker/party scene, I was there for 2 weeks and didn't see one child during my stay. The hostel has loud music playing outside Untill late so it probably isn't very suitable!",0
4373,FreehandManagement,Dec 2014,"Hi there, While we do not offer private parking, there is street parking available around the Hostel. Street parking is $1 per hour on the meter (free from 6pm-8am).

4430,Al H,May 2017,There are several restaurants within walking distance but most of the upmarket ones are further than I want to walk. I used Uber and it worked well and was very inexpensive.,0

4434,Ouppoeps,Feb 2017,"ALL hotels will have an official check-in as well as check-out time. Check-in here is not before 14:00 hours, this allows for cleaning of rooms occupied the night before. You will be allowed to store your luggage while you go for a walk or shopping or swim until the check-in time. I find this useful. Occasionally, your allocated room may not have been used the night before (example ""out of season""), in which case it ""may"" be available before the formal check-in time. You will only find this out when you stand at the check-in desk (if you phone, you will almost always be told that ""the check-in time is formally not before 14:00""). However, allowing you into your room before the formal check-in time is at the discretion of the hotel and staff, is a ""bonus"" if/when it happens and should clearly not be an expectation. This is a large hotel with many rooms, so you may well be pleasantly surprised. Good luck. Ouppoeps",0

4437,John P,Nov 2016,The Hotel is separated from the beach front by a broad walk. This is accessible from the Hotel. To see the sights of Miami you need a car.

4447,Blancheee,Oct 2015,Hi there. I doubt it - it is pretty far away from Fort Lauderdale. I would suggest finding a hotel in Fort Lauderdale if you are going on a cruise. There is a Marriott Renaissance that I have stayed at which is really nice and has shuttle service. I'm not sure if they offer parking - I know there are some hotels in Fort Lauderdale that offer cruise parking and it's a fraction of the cost to park at the port. Good luck!,0

4450,Domonic G,Jul 2015,"Hello. If you mean ""close by"" as in ""walking distance"", there is a Subway Eatery located in a hotel directly across the street from Best Western Atlantic. Look for the Subway sign on the hotel. There is a Burger King located several blocks from Best Western on Route 112. Head out on 41st Avenue, and it's on your left side. It may be a bit far to walk. You may want to drive. As for convenience stores and liquor stores, there are a variety up and down Collins Avenue, but you will probably want to drive. Most of the convenience stores and liquor stores are located in the heart of South Beach. Especially Washington Avenue. Note: If you are driving, parking is very very very limited on South Beach, including at your hotel. You will be placed on a waiting list at your hotel. While waiting, you can park across the street at a private parking facility for about $30.00 not per day, but each time you ""leave and re-enter"" the garage. If you are not driving and want everything within walking distance, you may want to get an hotel in the heart of South Beach. Previously, I have stayed on Espanola Way/Washington Avenue at the Clay Hotel. Everything is within walking distance, including Ocean Drive, Lincoln Road, convenience stores, liquor stores, etc. The Clay Hotel price is reasonable, and you can't beat the location. If you decide to stay at Best Western Atlantic, it is a nice hotel, and the staff are friendly and very helpful. Have fun in Miami and Good Luck.",0

We walked around 1/2 block to the beach(either past the Raleigh which was closer to chairs and umbrellas or between SLS and THE DELANO)...almost the same distance from walking through the back of Marseilles if it were open.,0

4555,Nicol√°s B,Nov 2016,"Hola elizbetc, yo no soy muy exigente a la hora de elegir un hotel, donde sea limpio y seguro ya se gan√≥ el cielo.

Seguridad: 10 puntos. Algo a favor del Marseilles es que desde su piscina baj√°s directo a la playa, con el Dorchester tendr√≠as que caminar 1 cuadra, y sin dudas la piscina del Marseilles es m√°s linda.

4563,akiva2016,Apr 2016,"Hola. Cuando nosotros hicimos la reserva del hotel Marseilles, a trav√©s de la agencia de viajes, nos comunicaron que el desayuno estaba incluido y asi fue. Podiamos elegir 3 ingredientes dentro de una lista, pero hab√≠a otras opciones. Nosotros desayunamos un bowl con fruta fresca, luego tostadas o un bagel tostado con queso de untar y mermelada, acompa√±ado de cafe, o te o cortado sin limite. En cuanto a malls, sobre la calle peatonal Lincoln Road, hay muchisimos locales de ropa y otros articulos asi como tambi√©n un local de Maicy¬¥s pr√≥ximo . De lo contrario hay que tomar un taxi y el shopping m√°s proximo es el Dolphin Mall, muy bueno!! Est√° pasando el aeropuerto. Un poco m√°s lejos est√° el famoso outlet Sawgrass y hay que averig√ºar porque ellos tienen un omnibus que pasa a buscar a los huespedes por los hoteles y los traslado de regreso al hotel. Comer hoy en Miami depende mucho del lugar. Hay locales CVS y Walgreen¬¥s que venden comida o para micro o sanwiches deliciosos asi como diversidad de bebidas a bajo costo. Almorzar o cenar puede ir desde U$30 a U$60. Frente al Hotel Marseilles est√° Maxine¬¥s Bar y Bistr√≥, muy bueno, donde comer un plato cada uno o incluso compartido con una peque√±a entrada, mas bebida cuesta alrededor de U$37. Los precios han subido pero siempre se consigue reducir el gasto. Espero haber respondido a tus inquietudes,",0

En cuanto a ir al Sawgrass el hotel no dispone del traslado. Si hay una representante de una agencia que te contrata el servicio, con un costo por pasajero y horario de salida y regreso predeterminado. Va pasando por diferentes hoteles, lo comento para calcular el tiempo de aprovechamiento del paseo de compras -el lugar es enorme y alejado-.- Si es un grupo opino que conviene un taxi, contratado desde el hotel para que no te paseen y cobren demasiado. As√≠ hicimos nosotros que fuimos tres, con el mismo conductor acordamos el regreso llamandolo al celular cuando quisimos volver. Todo sali√≥ Ok. en nuestro caso fuimos al Dolphin un poco mas cerca y lleno de tiendas. Espero te ayude mi comentario. Mariale",1

You can grab an Uber to Lincoln Road Mall for about $7-$9. However you can take a stroll down the board walk or down Collins ave down to Lincoln. It‚Äôs a good 30 - 40 minute walk enjoying the sights and sounds, step in to a bar or two and enjoy the scene (there are plenty along the way). When you get to Lincoln Road Head west a couple of blocks and you have arrived. Plenty of food options, Cuban, Brazilian, Italian, desserts, etc. Hope you enjoy your experience Ernie!",0
4726,Chris E,Jan 2018,Yes there is pool furniture. For restaurants there is little - a Subway across the street? It's best to get a ten minute cab ride to Lincoln Road where there are dozens of great restaurants - be prepared to queue.,0
4726,Angie R,Jan 2018,Other restaurants apart from the hotel are a trek if you are walking or about ten mins in a cab - if u get a cab opposite the hotel make sure you know where you are going as many of the taxi drivers seemed a little clueless. You are at the very far end of south beach Not sure about beach chairs - sorry !,0

And for the price of a taxi ride to the hotel and back, we travelled all the week long. The #150 leaves you 2 blocks from the hotel. It may take up to15 mins for buses to arrive and during rush hours up to '45 to get to Downtown Miami (via South Beach). With the same ticket we took buses to South and North Beach, Bal Harbour, Aventura Mall, etc and the train and bus connection to Coconut Grove. The pool is ok.

You are not on the main strip ( Ocean Drive ) you are approx 2 blocks away. So the Nightlife won't be encountered too much. They will love the Pool. And your steps away from the Beach. There is a Boardwalk between the hotel and the beach. While my wife and I walked on the Boardwalk we saw a few people on Rented Bikes! You'll be fine.,0

Also connected to adjacent public beach which goes on forever (see pics in my review). Nothing was crowded when we were there. By April it will likely be the same. Not a party stretch. Those are a few miles south. If your kids are young the job is to keep track of them. Have a good time.,0

The pool area is nice, and as well there is a nice open grassy area where they can run and play games, toss a beach ball. You also have the boardwalk and you can walk a very short bit and the stairs are right there to the beach. This hotel is kind of outside of the party area, which makes it even better for families. Also, I am born and raised in Florida and by the first week of April, you are correct, most Spring breakers will be gone. Have an amazing trip!!!",0

4892,Tawayne W,Jul 2017,The strangest practice I've seen at a hotel. Unfortunately we didnt ask this question before our stay. I do not know what the deposit is for but you will get it back at the end of your stay. How long that will take I cannot say. Save yourself the trouble and book another place. The Breakwater is awful in every way. My partner and I booked for 5 days through United Airlines. We left the hotel by the second night for the W Hotel. My partner called United to tell Them of our issues and we were later issued a full refund from the hotel because United threatened to drop them as an affiliate. This could have been really awful seeing as how everyone can not afford to change hotels mid stay.This may be the reason for the deposit. To recoup their losses when people leave early.,0

The owners have conected the original Betsy via a bridge (from the outside it looks like a huge white doughnut suspended a floor up and pushed between the two properties. interior wise the original hotel has a colonial feel the addon is a mixture of art deco and minimalist. To get from the original hotel to the addon is like a maze, but in a good way. The entrance to the second part is on the block behind the original Betsy. Personally I enjoyed my stay in the original but in truth have never stayed in the addons so I can't give you details between the experience of both.",0
4960,David R,Dec 2017,"Hi Judith, All depends on what you are looking for, if you want traditional then I would go for colonial, this is where we stayed and loved the rooms.

If not, you'll be going up & down elevators many times. We were in the Deco building which has a lobby facing Collins Ave & a walkway (Where you'll pass the new pizza shop) to Ocean Ave which we used to avoid the hallways & elevator rides. If noise is a problem (though we faced Collins and it was no problem when we slept but noisy during the day with drapes & windows open) ask for a courtyard room in either building.

I was there in April and courtyard pool was deathly quiet (think I saw a couple of older people there once in 4 days) and the rooftop pool was busier but never packed and always possible to get sun loungers, even over a weekend. The beach is across the road, maybe a 5 min walk for the able bodied but plenty of loungers and umbrellas all included in your resort fee. So plenty of options for you and your mum to sun bathe.

There are no hidden charges for anything in our hotel, everything is clear from our side, now if you use an agent that don't provide you all the information before your decision, I am very sorry, but this is not hotels fault, if you check on our public information, all is clear. And, today is very easy to get all the info, it is impossible someone charging for hidden charges. I will explain you what you may refer, you may refer to RESORT FEE, the resort fee is a mandatory fee, that your agent can charge you or tell, you have to pay it at the hotel, if you buy directly from us, this is what we do, we inform at the time of reservation, what you have to pay. In this case the RESORT FEE, is not for towels or for Pool chairs whatever was said here in this forum, it is a group of services, the hotel provide to its guests as all other hotels in Miami do, some with more inclusions, other with less inclusions, in our case it costs 24US + 14% txs per day, per room, and includes the following: 2 beach sunbeds + 1 Umbrella + 2 bottles of water, per day, at our private beach area, towels to use at the beach also, In-room Coffee/Tee making facilities with daily refill, Two bottles of water per day in your room, free usage of the business center, domestic telephone calls, bathrobes in the room, in-room safety box with capacity for a laptop, as you can see there is much more than just beach towels.

5027,WalesSteve,Oct 2017,"Breakfast was about 12 dollars a day when we stayed at this hotel 4 weeks ago. This was only if booked when checking in and for the full duration of your stay.There was of course the usual tax and service charges added which generally in the whole of the Miami beach area means you need to add at least 50 per cent on top of every basic price quoted. I can only suggest it's not cheap for breakfast but you are not going to find anything cheaper unless you go to a supermarket or McDonalds. Beware that the 18 dollars a day tax you pay when checking out is only the basic tax. It works out about 23 dollars a day after city, state and local tax are added. Also the tax may cover 2 sunbeds on the beach (and some small in room extras such as a half bottle of water and tea and coffee and dressing gowns) but you will have to pay 15 dollars extra per day for an umbrella (plus tax)!!",1

5028,Catarina M,Sep 2017,"Dear Claireser, Thank you for staying with us on this visit to Miami Beach. Regarding your questions: Car Parking, the hotel provides a service of Valet Parking with unlimited in and out times, at a cost of 39US + 7% sales Tax, per day, and on the check-out day you cau use until 2:00 pm, hotel check-out time is 12:00 noon. The resort fee is 18US + 14%Txs per room, per day and it includes, 2 sunbeds on our private beach area, (NOTE: The Umbrella on the beach is not included, is up to you to rent if you want) beach towels to use at the pool and beach, coffee and tea making facilities in your room with daily refill, (just to correct WALES STEVEN, on his comment above, the coffee and tea is in the room for one day, however if the guest drinks more, he can request at reception and we will send more to the room. I am very sorry he/she didnt understand that, because nowhere it says is only one dose per day) usage of our business center, computer, printer, scanner etc.....Bathrobes in the room and in-room safety box, it is all writen on your registration card that you fill-up at check-in. Regarding the area, is very safe, you can walk on the street anytime, day and night without any problems, I am at the hotel for 2 and half years, we never had a problem with security and safety in the area. I hope I have clarified your doubts. Sincerely, Jorge Tito General Manager",0
5028,WalesSteve,Sep 2017,My review is just about to be posted (I hope) and that will answer most of your questions. However I can confirm the hotel is in a good location and very safe area at night. The parking is very expensive. Whilst we did not use a car I have seen parking costs around the area of at least 30 dollars a night. There is a free safe in each room. My main concern is the resort fee of 18 dollars per room per night and for this you get a sunbed on the beach but no umbrella (for which is an extra 15 dollars per day). It also includes use of pool towels which can be taken to the beach and 2 cups of tea or coffee per room per day (it may be more to be fair but you are only given 2 paper cups a day and 2 sugar and milk sachets). Generally you will enjoy visiting South Miami beach at least to say you have been but bring plenty of cash as London (and Leeds) prices are cheap compared to Miami.,1

Waht I can tell you at this moment is the following, we reversed the money on your credit card on July 24th, which we already explained answering your email regarding this issue, I understand your frustrations if you didnt receive yet the money on your account, but this is something we can¬¥t help, you need to talk to your bank. As I said we reversed the money on the day you canceled the reservation, and you received a communication from our Reservations Manager - Jelena Vecic. I am very sorry, but at this stage it is out of our control to tell you when you can expect your money. I hope it is clear from our side, and I hope your bank process it fast.

We dont provide any transfers from or to the Port. The best is to use UBER, you can use the APP on your cell phone, or you can call the hotel to send you an UBER to pick you there. Or you use a Taxi, the cost of a Taxi is normal double of the UBER cost. if you wnat the hotel to send you an UBER to pick you at the terminal, you need to call the hotel, give your name and a precise point to pick you at the terminal, when I say a precise point, I mean a very precise, with a Street name and number so we can call it over the APP. This will be debited directly to your room account, you dont need to pay anything and use money or CC. I hope this information helps you. Looking forward to welcome you.

5048,Catarina M,Aug 2016,"Bonsoir Mme./M. AX I am the General Manager of the hotel and I am very happy that you make this question here, so you can hear different opinions, as GM here I can give all the info needed, regarding opinion about how welcome children are at the hotel, I have my own opinion and it is always debatable, as I will say yes, but I suggest you read other guests comments and you take your own conclusion As info: Pool is open from 7:00am to 11:00pm Breakfast, if you booked directly with the hotel, on our site or with our call center, is always included in your room rate. If you didn¬¥t, you have 2 options, buy a package for all your stay at check-in time, the price vary from US10,50 to US14,50 + Txs per person, per day, depending on the season. OR You go whenever you wat to the restaurant and at the spot the cost is US17,5 + Txs per person As your concern about the hotel being quiet, I can assure you the hotel is very quiet, is on a residential area, far from the party hotels, although on a walking distance to all the interesting points, as beach, Ocean Drive, Lincold Road, Collins Avenue etc.......you will be on the best location regarding what you looking for. I would suggest you do your reservation at the hotel website, where you will find the best conditions for sure, and remember, if you book direct, Resort fee and breakfast is included. Looking forward to welcome you. Sincerely, Jorge Tito",1
5048,Hartelius,Aug 2016,"Hi - we stayed here in the beginning of July with our 3 teenagers - aged 16,16 and 12. And we felt very welcomed by the staff - there was a nice atmosphere and seemed quiet. We had the breakfast menu and it is very nice - and okay priced too. The area of the hotel is nice, clean and quiet and only five minutes walk away from all the buzz So yes - I would recommend this hotel too :-)",1
5048,Shrimps4us,Aug 2016,"Hello We had a family room with 2 double beds in, they are small and the room is too. Our children were 12 and 13 at the time and were very welcome at the hotel which was quiet. Can't answer about the pool times I'm afraid but we did see teens in the pool at about 10pm. If you do decide to go I would recommend getting the breakfast deal they recommend. When you arrive you are bombarded with questions and I had to decide on $40 a day breakfast, for four. I said no but asked could I change my mind, they said no. However, chatting to the owner one night he said we could change our minds. Breakfast was good and a cheaper option than nearby cafe which was $15 for breakfast set deal. Hope that helps.",1
5048,Rosanne731,Aug 2016,Family friendly the pool can be used any time and it's heated. Breakfast can be added cheaper at check in I think it was 20 a person but well worth it. It's location is quiet but so close to walk to beach. I highly recommend it.,1
5048,Iliketotakeiteasy,Aug 2016,"When we stayed there were families with older children (I would say 7+ years) who were playing in the pool. The cost of breakfast was included in the room price. I think the pool closes in the evening - not sure of the hours. The hotel is quiet. It is within easy walking distance of the beach and bars but is not on the loud party strip itself, so a good location.",1
5048,nannyged,Aug 2016,"Hello There were young families staying at the Pestana when we were there but much younger than your children. As a previous adviser has said, there may not be enough entertainment around the pool for your children's age group. Breakfast was plentiful and was included in the price of our stay so I don't know how much you would have to pay for it separately. The hotel is very quiet and set back from the bustling Colins Avenue. I would imagine that Miami will be very busy at the Christmas holidays, so whether you will get some relaxation in Miami, is questionable.",1
5048,oatesfamily,Aug 2016,"Hello I personally would not choose this hotel for family and to rest . We thought breakfast was expensive for what it is , we did not see any children there . The hotel to us is more of a city break hotel . I think your children would be bored with the pool May be wrong but that is my observation",1
5048,Morten H,Aug 2016,"Hi. We visit this place in august this year. You can without problem stay here with the kids and family.

A very nice pool for kids, and a relaxing lounge around. The poolbar/restaurant offers ok food, at a fear price. We did not have breakfast there since it is a bunch of places to eat in walking distance. I would definitly vouch for this hotel. Br Morten",1

5048,dave h,Sep 2016,I can't unfortunately say about pool opening hours . We didn't travel with children and it seemed open from 7am until into the evening . We hardly spent time there during the day and when we did it was only a couple of hours mid afternoon when it was too hot to walk round . It is quiet tho sorry we can't be more helpful but it is genuinely a great hotel . We didn't do breakfast there as there is a place called Maxine's within 5 mins walk of the hotel which is very reasonably priced and delicious .,0

5072,Maximiliano Gueroyte,Nov 2018,"Hola! Aunque Pestana es una cadena portuguesa y se esmeran por poner empleados que hablen portugu√©s, en el de Miami muchos hablan espa√±ol, si justo en la recepci√≥n en ese momento no lo habla nadie seguro un botones puede ayudarte. Ah√≠ en el hotel tienen bicicletas para alquilar (unas pocas pero suficientes). El traslado al aeropuerto no est√° incluido pero pueden gestionarlo all√≠ mismo, o pedir un UBER, o UBER XL si llevan muchas maletas, o tambi√©n por internet un SuperShuttle compartido que creo es lo m√°s econ√≥mico luego del transporte p√∫blico. saludos",0
5072,Miguel P,Nov 2018,"Hola! no hay inconveniente en dejar las valijas. En general hablan espa√±ol, y el Gerente,creo que se llama Pepe, se lo ve casi permanentemente, es muy atento y habla castellano perfectamente.

5252,George B,Mar 2018,The answers provided are out of date as the hotel is undergoing major construction. I would certainly stay here as the place is a construction site and will last for a long time. Suggest you book elsewhere to avoid severe disappointment. When we arrived the taxi could not find it with sat nav. This place is a bomb site and has no food available or breakfast and we were expected to carry our heavy suitcases up a spiral staircase. We arrived at 9pm and moved to another hotel at 10pm - a complete joke of a place and should not remain open during major refurbishment.,0

5259,215AC,May 2016,Hi Lauren: I stayed at the Anglers and the pool area is smaller I think there are two bungaloos and 12-16 lounge chairs total but the property doesn't have that many rooms. It is a smaller pool area than some of the larger hotels in the area. Kimpton has a hotel called the surfcomber across the street with a bigger pool area and beach access. It's a great property. Probably a little pricier but might be worth it for what you are loooking for. I would give them a call. They are quite accomodating.,0

If its a companion dog there may be an exemption, however I highly doubt you could bring you pet along for a holiday. I have just been on 'bring fido' web site that advises it is no longer a pet friendly hotel. I believe the ownership may have changed. If you Google 'bring fido' you may locate a hotel in South Beach that is pet friendly Hope this has helped in some way :) Thanks J",0
5403,Jade O,Mar 2016,Nope. This hotel is not part of the beach chairs and umbrella group that man these facilities on the beach. Which I thought was a bit of a disappointment. Plus its really expensive to hire chairs and umbrellas on the beach if your hotel is not part of the group.,0

Highly recommend it!!",0
5435,AnjiA,Aug 2018,"Hi, I can strongly recommend the Croydon Hotel, but we had no luck with the airport shuttle service. We waited in vain at the airport according to instructions, but despite the timetable, the shuttle didn't arrive and we (four of us with quite a few suitcases) had to squash into a taxi which - fortunately for us - stopped close by, although this apparently is not generally acceptable. Having to be back at the airport at a certain time meant that the shuttle from the hotel did not fit in with our schedule (although the front desk was very obliging), and we booked an Uber. You won't regret choosing this hotel, but I wouldn't base your decision on the shuttle :) Enjoy!",0

5440,AJP57,Jan 2017,"Parking is offered for a fee but parking in Miami Beach is problematical in that it's difficult to find and can be expensive. You really don't need a car here with Uber and public transportation. I have a reloadable transit card from the Miami-Dade Transit system (called Easy Card) so I just add money onto my card online whenever I travel there. You can purchase temporary cards called Easy Tickets at the airport at the Transit station which is accessed via airport train from Concourse E. From there, you can catch the Airport Flyer express bus, #150, that will arrive at the Hotel Croydon in about 35 minutes for only about $2.35-2.50 per person and the bus has luggage racks. Having the EasyCard allows you to catch buses without paying separately for each bus because the transfer period is built into the card. There are no paper bus transfers in effect. You just need to add enough money onto your card to last during your entire stay because you can't load money onto the cards on the buses. The Airport Flyer runs regularly. I always take it when staying in Miami Beach and save that taxi fare of approximately $35 for other things. Each person needs their individual Easy Card. Look up Miami-Dade Transit's website since I can't include it in this message.",5

You would know your girls best if they are fine sharing a bed. I can tell you I have 2 boys and at that age they would not sleep in the same bed. I found out the hard way on a trip.

You will NOT be dissapointed. We can't wait to return!,1
5613,Carter27,Apr 2016,"We enjoyed the city view from a corner roof top terrace, the corner terraces are the most private and well worth the money... Your own little paradise. South beach is beautiful from anywhere, I believe the ocean views are only partial. I doubt you will be disappointed.",0
5613,Ashley B,Apr 2016,"I disagree. You will be dissapointed with the city view. Seeing ocean drive, the waves, the palm trees is well worth the extra money.

Pedi por el olor fuerte ya que soy alergica y me dijeron que iban a pedir a limpieza que tire menos desodorante de ambiente , pero el olor nunca se iba hasta que me puse a buscar y habia un aparato enchufado que largaba mucho olor. No costaba nada decirlo mas si te digo que soy alergica !!!. La puerta no cerraba de lo hinchada que estaba !. Costaba abrirla y cerrarla. Estuvimos en la habitacion 142 .

5897,JAMC1968,Nov 2014,"Hola Constanza. La verdad los Malls buenos no est√°n cerca, es m√°s est√°n lejos (45 minutos en auto), yo arrend√© auto y me fui todo el d√≠a, as√≠ lo pude recorrer de buena forma. Ocean Drive tampoco est√° cerca, debes ir en locomoci√≥n, Si hay un supermercado a una cuadra y media, donde te recomiendo q vayas a comprar jugos, snacks, frutas y los guardas en el frigobar de tu habitaci√≥n. La playa est√° a 3 minutos, es pr√°cticamente cruzar la calle. Solicita toallas en la recepci√≥n cuando vayas. Para caminar te recomiendo ir hacia el norte, y debes ir a si o si a Ocean Drive, ah√≠ est√°nas mejores playas y restaurantes. Suerte y que tengas un buen viaje",2
5897,dba993,Nov 2014,"Hola Constanza, yo arrend√© en Sixt y no tuve problemas (te recomiendo contratar los seguros a terceros y si pagas con tarjeta de credito Gold o Platinum va un seguro para el auto incluido). Si tienes licencia chilena puedes conducir en Miami, no es necesaria la licencia de conducir internacional. Intenta llevar un GPS o arrienda un auto con GPS ya que as√≠ es mucho mas f√°cil manejarse all√°.

5897,Leone45,Nov 2014,"Hola Buenos Dias!, decieme a que te refer√≠s como ""sector comercial"" cual va a ser el motivo del viaje ?(playa, compras, descanso). la zona de bares y movida nocturna es al sur, entre las calles 5 y 18, el hotel esta en la 66, como poder, podes ir caminando pero va ser un poco largo, hay omnibus que te llevan de un lado al otro, o taxi. Para hacer compras tipo ""shoping"" lo mejor es ir a los centro comerciales o malls pero para eso hace falta auto, tranfer o calectivo , en ese orden(de mas comodo a menos comodo), el mall mas proximo es a unos 20 min en auto, aunque si vas a orlando todo tiene mejor precio alli. En el hotel tienen servicio de tours, habla con los chicos de la recepci√≥n que son excelentes, Michele, Yosbel, Pilar y Cesar, Hay un omnibus que te lleva no recuerdo bien a que mall, que pasa por la collins y para en la otra cuadra del hotel , pero tene en cuenta que es un omnibus urbano o sea que puede demorar muchoooo y estar lleno, tambien a tener en cuenta que tenes que contar con cambio para el pago ya que no dan vuelto. sin lugar a duda, lo mejor es que vayas con alguien en auto por la libertad de tiempo y porque a la vuelta te venis cargado siempre. Si vas a orlando traete la mayoria de las cosas de ahi porque es mas barato. cualquier cosa que pueda ayudarte, ni lo dudes saludos",1
5897,sergiocasanovas7,Oct 2015,"No queda para nada cerca y en ese sector el transporte publico es muy escaso, con respecto al Mall, te recomiendo Dolphin Mall es mucho mas barato todo y en todas las tiendas, Sawgrass esta muy lejos, en Fort Lauderdale como a 1 hora y media de donde estas y Dolphin esta la lado del aeropuerto, de agencias no se porque arrende auto y lleve un GPS, la mejor soluci√≥n.",0

N√£o fique entrando e saindo do shopping para por compras no carro. Leve malas para suas compras.

5948,Jasondenny,Aug 2018,I am guessing that the resort fee of 30 dollars per night ( includes the 2 dollars for tax ) just applies in peak season or is fairly new. I personally think it lacks transparency in terms of paying in advance and then having to pay an add on . That said midt hotels at peak times in prime locations play the same trick . The Crest would say that this includes the beach facilities and the basic breakfast . The Crest is ok but does not compare with best western or Staybridge which I stayed in as I completed my USA tour . If I go to Miami again I will stay 10 streets up in modern hotel at a much cheaper rate .,1

We prefer the beach and also their honesty about the pool situation and the construction on the cabanas which blocked direct access to the beach. We walked around 1/2 block to the beach(either past the Raleigh which was closer to chairs and umbrellas or between SLS and THE DELANO)...almost the same distance from walking through the back of Marseilles if it were open.,0

You do not need to rent a car at this hotel the location is that good. Parking can be anywhere from $15-$35 a day, so it is not worth it and you can get cabs anywhere if you do not want to walk. The location is what this place has going for it and that is all. The hotel is beachfront and you can use the pool and beach umbrellas ,chairs for free at the hotel next door which is only a few steps away. I booked on Hotwire in the blind and got a great price but was not aware of the pool situation until after I booked.",0

Personal del hotel pasar√° por el lugar y les solicitar√° las tarjetas que les fueron dadas para tal fin. Hay una suave pendiente para ingresar al agua y est√°n bien se√±alizados los l√≠mites para ba√±arse. El frigobar lo pueden solicitar en recepci√≥n, con un recargo diario de cinco d√≥lares.

6080,Nicol√°s B,Nov 2016,"Hola elizbetc, yo no soy muy exigente a la hora de elegir un hotel, donde sea limpio y seguro ya se gan√≥ el cielo. El tema es el siguiente: - Dorchester: Lo visit√© en 2013 y es aceptable, tiene piscina, servicio para lavar la ropa, heladera en las habitaciones, y si quer√©s sombrilla y sillas de playa pod√©s usar las del Marseilles (est√°n fijas en la playa y present√°s un papelito que te dan en el dorchester) Seguridad: 10 puntos Limpieza: 10 puntos - Marseilles: Fui el mes pasado, esta vez con mi beb√© y te soy sincero la habitaci√≥n que me toc√≥ (802) era una mugre, la alfombra estaba espantosa, el ba√±o sucio, hab√≠a un pegote en la mesa, no qued√© nada conforme con la habitaci√≥n, tal vez tuve mala suerte pero la habitaci√≥n estaba sucia. Seguridad: 10 puntos. Algo a favor del Marseilles es que desde su piscina baj√°s directo a la playa, con el Dorchester tendr√≠as que caminar 1 cuadra, y sin dudas la piscina del Marseilles es m√°s linda. Espero tengas buen viaje!",1

Podiamos elegir 3 ingredientes dentro de una lista, pero hab√≠a otras opciones. Nosotros desayunamos un bowl con fruta fresca, luego tostadas o un bagel tostado con queso de untar y mermelada, acompa√±ado de cafe, o te o cortado sin limite. En cuanto a malls, sobre la calle peatonal Lincoln Road, hay muchisimos locales de ropa y otros articulos asi como tambi√©n un local de Maicy¬¥s pr√≥ximo . De lo contrario hay que tomar un taxi y el shopping m√°s proximo es el Dolphin Mall, muy bueno!! Est√° pasando el aeropuerto. Un poco m√°s lejos est√° el famoso outlet Sawgrass y hay que averig√ºar porque ellos tienen un omnibus que pasa a buscar a los huespedes por los hoteles y los traslado de regreso al hotel. Comer hoy en Miami depende mucho del lugar. Hay locales CVS y Walgreen¬¥s que venden comida o para micro o sanwiches deliciosos asi como diversidad de bebidas a bajo costo. Almorzar o cenar puede ir desde U$30 a U$60. Frente al Hotel Marseilles est√° Maxine¬¥s Bar y Bistr√≥, muy bueno, donde comer un plato cada uno o incluso compartido con una peque√±a entrada, mas bebida cuesta alrededor de U$37.

En cuanto a ir al Sawgrass el hotel no dispone del traslado. Si hay una representante de una agencia que te contrata el servicio, con un costo por pasajero y horario de salida y regreso predeterminado. Va pasando por diferentes hoteles, lo comento para calcular el tiempo de aprovechamiento del paseo de compras -el lugar es enorme y alejado-.- Si es un grupo opino que conviene un taxi, contratado desde el hotel para que no te paseen y cobren demasiado.

Must of the clubs do have a cover charge specially on Friday and Saturday. a good local spot is Lost Weekend. also Do not sit on the furniture is very cool too. The Wolfsonian Museum is a must to know see the art Deco history of Miami and a nice long walk on the beack to south point Just perfect.

So avoid eating on ocean drive but if you'd like to drink Wet willies and Fat Tuesdays is amazing. I went to Miami by myself so I didn't want to really go clubbing or anything. There's an awesome pizza spot called Pizza Bar that was amazing and fairly cheap for a small pie. Also if you like tacos an amazing spot called Taquiza, the food was great at $3 a taco I believe. While I was there I just went to the beach and also did a bit of shopping on Lincoln Road which was about a 20 min walk from the hotel.

The chair/towel service is provided by a third-party that partners with the Plymouth, but is not quite the same quality of service provided by the hotel itself. You can order food and drinks through an app that is advertised on the beach (I am not aware if alcohol is available, since we did not use the app). Overall, with everything else to do in Miami, it was nice to have access to the beach, but we enjoyed the location and other activities as well. I feel the Plymouth is the best of both worlds.",1

I would assume check in is at 3 p.m.which is standard for most hotels but you can always put in a request for an early check in.

Ni por asomo esta categor√≠a de hotel puede tener semejante tarifa. En s√≠ntesis, si buscas algo barato, consegu√≠s tarifa barata y buscas playa, vale la pena. Caso contrario, busca otra opci√≥n. Espero te sea √∫til mi opini√≥n. Saludos",0

The driver will force as many people on as he can, regardless, and won't drive the bus with passengers standing in front of the white line, even if you have a toe over it.

6332,Jessica S,Aug 2016,"We walked to the strip everyday. We were on vacation so time was not an issue, I don't know how long it took to get to the strip because it was just a casual walking. One thing for sure is that it was not ridiculously far. The first two days we walked down Collins and it was fine but on the last day we walk to the Strip by way of the boardwalk...a much better walk. Oh, we walked day and night and felt safe! If you tend to be sedentary all the walking might be a bit much, it was okay for me. We didn't find much food...there is a very small strip with a few restaurants, local and franchise. When we were leaving, we found out that there were restaurants heading away from the strip. #40ish (age) #got my 10,000 steps (plus) daily",1

Nosotros requerimos una garantia addicional de $50.00 por dia por cargos extras, si no hay consumo en general la garantia se cancela en el momento del check out y despues de 3 a 5 dias habiles el monto es retornado a su cuenta. En referencia al resort fee de $20.00, eso es un cargo por habitacion por dia y le permite el accesso a poder usas 2 sillas en la piscina o playa en el Raleigh Hotel (a una cuadra del Townhouse Hotel) Espero que lo haya podido ayudar, si necesita cualquier otra ayuda no dude en contactarnos. Cordialmente, Arturo Ya√±ez Front Office Manager Townhouse Hotel",-1

6543,Erick P,Aug 2016,"N√£o tem cobran√ßa, mas preste aten√ß√£o no que vou lhe passar. Quando enviei um e-mail ao hotel dizendo que estava interessado em se hospedar nele, j√° perguntando se existia algum custo para que o hotel recebesse postagens, eles me responderam prontamente que n√£o havia custos. Fiz a reserva no hotel e inclusive, ap√≥s passar pelo hotel fiz uma √≥tima avalia√ß√£o sobre ele aqui no TripAdvisor. Quando da estadia comprei um Tenis da PUMA na internet de U$ 100,00 com o prazo de entrega de 5 dias √∫teis, como ainda tinha uns 15 dias nos EUA comprei o t√™nis. Acontece que depois da compra eu descobri que 5 dias √∫teis era s√≥ o prazo de entrega dos correios, tendo a empresa mais 20 dias para realizar a postagem. Aqui no brasil o prazo de entrega √© contando da data da sua compra, mas nos EUA, n√£o sei se √© em todas as empresas o prazo de entrega conta a partir do momento em que a empresa posta o objeto nos correios, tendo ainda mais um prazo para que a empresa poste o produto, entre ""aspas"". Ent√£o o t√™nis chegou depois que eu j√° tinha ido embora ao Brasil. Entrei em contato com a PUMA, expliquei minha situa√ß√£o. Eles disseram que bastava que o hotel devolvesse o t√™nis para eles que eu seria ressarcido dos custos e me enviaram um voucher dos correios onde j√° estava l√° tudo pronto, endere√ßo de entrega e custos dos correios. N√£o precisava o hotel nem ir nos correios, bastava entregar por carteiro que passa todos os dias l√°. Pois bem, quando eu mandei um e-mail dizendo que estava interessado em me hospedar eles me responderam em 5 minutos. Quando mandei um e-mail com o voucher pedindo que eles devolvessem o t√™nis.... Estou aguardando at√© hoje, rsrsrs. Falta de honestidade. Pelo menos √© um t√™nis bonito e tenho certeza que o funcion√°rio que esta usando ele esta feliz. Eu s√≥ desejo que esse cidad√£o americano seja recompensado pelas for√ßas divinas por seus atos.",1

6582,Alison K,Apr 2016,No the ocean is across Ocean Drive. Good people watching but very loud rooms with Club outside the front and music until 4AM. Difficulty sleeping. I would stay elsewhere and walk a block or two to party.,0

6584,ladycell,Feb 2016,depending on what's going on in Miami that weekend it may not be possible at this hotel. there is a live DJ in the courtyard. as my review stated this hotel is broken up into two parts you cannot tell from the outside but when you go in you can tell that the hotel has two separate areas but I don't think that there would be a room where you would not hear noise,0
6585,Yohann S,Aug 2016,Parking is quite expensive in that area as it is directly on the beach. I believe to my recollection its 42 dollars,0
6585,blackheath2,Feb 2016,"I fully agree with the previous two answers. Don't bother trying to find a vacant spot on the street, especially during the week-end. There are some parking garages but they are 4-5 blocks away. If you can afford to stay at the Breakwater, you should be able to afford the $42 charge plus valet tip.",0
6585,Dave H,Feb 2016,"We also used valet. It was $42 but we just spent 1 night and our time was limited. I think there self parking not to far away, we rode past while out biking.",0
6585,Mike S,Feb 2016,"Forget about finding overnight parking. The hotel offers valet parking for $42. Don't drive around and waste your vacation looking for the magical parking spot (unless you only plan to park for a few hours). Trust me, it was very frustrating until I just sucked it up and paid for valet.",0
6585,Turner N,Feb 2016,"Parking is on the street. There is no parking garage. This is a party hotel, so you would be lucky to find a parking spot. Parking is on the strip or on side streets. The front of the hotel is reserved for limos and cabs for drop off and pick-ups.",0
6585,familyadventures2,Feb 2016,"hi: We did not rent a car and therefore did not have a parking charge. We used transportation from the airport and if you are just going to South Beach and/or Miami, you really don't need a car. South Beach is completely walkable and Miami is just a cab ride or tour away. Enjoy and I'm jealous because I want to go back.",-1
6586,Maria F,Dec 2015,Not really this hotel faces the ocean so there is no private area for hotel guests; the only thing private is their pool.,0

6586,BonaGirl67,Dec 2015,There is no special section but there is plenty of room if you bring your own chairs or you can rent chairs and umbrellas. It is a great location for South Beach activity,0
6586,Turner N,Dec 2015,"I'm truly not certain. The beach is just across the street from the hotel within walking distance. The sand and the water was very clean. As a matter of fact l saw the tractors grading the sand early that morning, and workers picking up and trash that they saw. I think that the hotel supplies beach towels. I don't remember. But I can say that it was very nice.",0
6586,Jim H,Dec 2015,"Yes, there is an area with available chairs, towels, etc! Just head onto the beach across from the hotel! Enjoy!",0
6586,Shane K,Dec 2015,Not really you can go straight across the street to public access and it is very wide open there. Have sank shake chair and umbrella rental and a Alice guard rescue and even water sports. The hotel offers complimentary beach towels and bottled water. Also have bikes free to use on the board walk ver nice in the morning. Hope this helps.,0
6586,Elizabeth M,Dec 2015,No there is.not the beach is across the street from the hotel but that being said you are right on Ocean Drive .,0
6586,Mikey D,Dec 2015,No. The beach front is across Ocean Drive and beyond the park that runs the length of it. It's all public beach. All the vendors that you rent chairs and umbrellas from are all run by the same outfit as well.,0

Example: It was stressing arriving in the evening and to ask day by day to have the towels replaced. The problem was that they moved all the towels even not laying on the floor (so not to be replaced) and leaving just one shower towel or one face towel. What sense???",0

The owners have conected the original Betsy via a bridge (from the outside it looks like a huge white doughnut suspended a floor up and pushed between the two properties. interior wise the original hotel has a colonial feel the addon is a mixture of art deco and minimalist. To get from the original hotel to the addon is like a maze, but in a good way. The entrance to the second part is on the block behind the original Betsy. Personally I enjoyed my stay in the original but in truth have never stayed in the addons so I can't give you details between the experience of both.",0

A courtyard one (always quiet, loads of space, just next to reception so super easy access for anyone with walking or mobility issues) and a busier but nicer rooftop pool which is trickier to access as your room maybe in a different wing to the hotel. I was there in April and courtyard pool was deathly quiet (think I saw a couple of older people there once in 4 days) and the rooftop pool was busier but never packed and always possible to get sun loungers, even over a weekend. The beach is across the road, maybe a 5 min walk for the able bodied but plenty of loungers and umbrellas all included in your resort fee. So plenty of options for you and your mum to sun bathe. It's a fab hotel, highly recommended.",1

6645,sunshine810,Jun 2017,I was there in Feb of this year and it was around supper time when we went to see the pool. We had been at the beach earlier. There was no one in the pool at that time of day so I can't say if it is a better choice than the beach. The weather was perfect so I assume everyone was across the street at the beach. It is a bit of a trek across the street but the beach is beautiful.,1

6646,SteveBfreqtraveler,May 2017,The hotel said that they dont rent umbrellas and chairs etc. they referred us to the concession on the beach. It cost us $20 per reclining chair with 1 umbrella included from the concession. The hotel did lend us beach towels at no charge. They said it was covered by the resort fee of $30 daily.,1
6646,drummer'sgirl,May 2017,The beach chairs and umbrella are included in your resort fee. I always tip the set up person. Many hotels in Miami Beach don't include the umbrella and some not even the chairs so it's nice to have that included!,1

I do recommend you read some reviews before booking and decide this is the hotel you want to stay, but if you already did that and the smoking is your only concern, you should be fine.

6737,JPrince42,Feb 2017,"I concur with the other answers, it all depends on availability at the time. The do try their best to accommodate though, including later check outs too if needed.",0

6738,AFoodieDMV,Feb 2017,"The SLS is very particular about which amenities Redbury guests have access to (just gym and beach). Not quite sure why as the demographic has changed and plummeted. No reason for the exclusivity. I am not aware of the Delano affiliation, unless it is a new merger.",0
6738,1TNtraveler,Feb 2017,"You have access to the SLS's gym and the Raleigh's pool. You can also access the Raleigh's pool area & restrooms through a secured gate from the beach (this is very helpful since there are no beach facilities nearby). We enjoyed the Raleigh's pool and were able to charge food and drinks to our room at The Redbury. I'm not aware that there is any affiliation with the Delano, but it is only a block away from The Redbury.",0
6738,Alex F,Feb 2017,"I'm not sure, but you definitely have access to the Raleigh which is the hotel across the street which has a nice pool. You can put food items on your room at the Redbury.",0

6739,Chrismasi,Jan 2017,Thanks Alan!,0
6740,lily23007,Jan 2017,Although we didnt get in quite as early as you - use a Miami airport taxi or uber - much cheaper and right there. We used Uber a lot in Miami (recommended by the Mandarin Oriental) absolutely a third of the price of city taxis.,2
6740,Candace J,Jan 2017,we hired a car to take us. Uber is probably less expensive than taxi.,1

6742,AFoodieDMV,Sep 2016,"Yes - you may use the Raleigh pool, although the redbury pool is nice and quiet. Downside is that there is not a bar not music - just quiet small rooftop pool.

6742,sullyontv,Jan 2017,Yes,1
6742,sullyontv,Jan 2017,The answer is yes! As far is I know! Maybe call the hotel and ask them:-),1

6742,DEZ,Sep 2016,"Yes. Redbury guests can take full advantage of the pool at the Raleigh. I just came back and went to the pool there at least three times. It was beautiful. Also, if you're at any sbe property (the Raleigh, SLS, etc), you can charge directly to your room anything you may order at the pool bar if you don't like carrying cash. Just have your hotel key handy. Hope this helps.",1
6742,Steve Buckley,Sep 2016,Sorry I didn't make use of the Raliegh's swimming pool facility so - to clear up any misunderstanding - suggest you contact the Redbury direct to clarify matters.,1

6744,Mario,Apr 2016,"For such a fancy and expensive hotel, I do not think there are good options for in-room coffee. You would be better off having coffee at the McDonald's a few blocks away. Having said that, I did not have the chance to try the coffee from their downstairs restaurant.",0
6745,Lynn Y,Feb 2016,"Access to beach is available. The hotel across the street is a sister property, so you may use their pools, rent an ocean side chair/ cabana, charge to your room food and drink etc....",0
6746,Peanutprettybird,Feb 2016,Our room looked over Collins Street but was directly over the restaurant which you could hear the bass from the music on the weekend. I don't think you really need a room with a view here as the location and proximity is great for south beach. Very easy to walk across the street to the beach. Make sure you try the Italian bakery just down the street. We had booked through Trip Advisors service and somehow our dates were off by one day as they thought were were coming the day before. The front desk was very nice and accommodating with this and all questions we asked every time we came by. Have a fun trip!,1
6746,Constanza T,Feb 2016,"I had a no view room (but with just one king bed). It had a window which was fine, we could see the inside of the entrance to the hotel, we did not see Collins or the 16th street, but found it not to be a problem. Also, it was very nice and quiet.",1
6746,TedW67,Feb 2016,"Not sure, but do yourself a favor and stay anywhere else in South Beach. The entire front desk staff copped major attitude for absolutely no reason.",1
6746,Mat√≠as D,Feb 2016,"I think the Hotel should confirm, but my guess is that ""no view"" could not mean that the room has no windows, so it should mean that the window has view to the inner sales of the hotel and not to directly to the streets. If that is the case, when we were there the room was a ""no view"" one, but that was not a problem at all; all the contrary, it was better since we did not face the street, which gets busy at night.",0
6746,Orlando J,Feb 2016,"I had a room with one king size bed with a terrible view. Hotel is close to the beach but lacks several amenities such as a small refrigerator, ice machine, and a microwave!! I suggest you look at other hotels.",0

6752,Kern H,Jan 2015,South Beach is a bit like Manhattan in that there is not much available street parking. In many areas you have to have a resident sticker to park overnight on the street. From the Redbury your best bet would be to look for a pay lot several blocks to the west and north. This starts to get you out of the hotel/tourist area.,0
6752,Andr√© M,Jan 2015,"If you are concerned about saving some bucks, and will not use your car a lot, I recommend you to park at the public parking at 16th street. Probably half the price charged by any hotel (I think around 16-18 us$/day).",0
6752,susanjholiday,Jan 2015,We didn't have a car but another guest told us that it was expensive to park at the Redbury but it seems that all hotels near the beach charge a lot. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. It is a lovely hotel though,0
6752,Barnchester,Jan 2015,"There's valet parking at the side which is really handy. There is a charge for it, but I think all Miami South Beach hotels will charge. It's a great hotel, great location - we loved it. Staff are excellent and the room was brilliant. Nice bar, pricey but then that's South Beach for you. We'd definitely stay here again.",0

6757,Liecel,Aug 2014,"Generally I would say ""no"". It is situated a few blocks away from the busy, club scene. And the price point and atmosphere attracts a more sophisticated crowd.

6798,dyan66,Aug 2021,"We stayed at the hotel last April, towards the end of spring break and it was very quiet at night. I think because the hotel is at the end of South Beach it caters to an older crowd.",0
6799,alex112597,Jul 2021,No executive lounge but you get a $20 per person breakfast credit at the Greek restaurant. We went there every day and loved it. Even ate dinner there a couple of times.,0

6800,Carlos,Apr 2021,"Good afternoon Navigator28050975080 Thank you for your message. Yes, the Hilton Bentley Miami South Beach does have an outdoor hot tub. The hot tub is located in the 4th floor solarium area. We look forward to having you as our guest in near future. Regards CC",1
6800,dcyonce,May 2021,Well ... sort of. No hot tub near the pool. Instead there is one on the 4th floor balcony. Just ask at the front desk.,0
6801,Carlos,Mar 2021,Hi! Thank you for your message. Thank you for choosing the Hilton Bentley Miami South Beach. Our Beach Club team members starts setting up at 08:00 am daily and city of Miami Beach Allows us to sit our first guest at 10:00 am. This would give you plenty of time to enjoy a delicious breakfast prior to visiting the beach club. We have enough beach chairs and umbrellas to tend to all of our guest and I am confident you and your husband will have a fantastic time here with us. We look forward to having you with us.,1
6801,Travelerfromtexas1,Jul 2021,"They seem to have enough for their guest. They tell you the beach service opens at 10am, but if you are not there by 9 am you will not have a front row view of the beach.",0

6803,Travelerfromtexas1,Jul 2021,In the evenings they have live music by the pool. It is nice except that we could hear it INSIDE our room on the 8th floor with the TV on. It‚Äôs too loud!,0
6803,timothybK2389HL,Jan 2020,"There was music playing near the outside bar, but it was current / pop, and not loud. I do not recall hearing it in the hotel or around the property.",0

6805,Terrence D,Jul 2019,"This popular SOBE hotel usually adheres to the 12 PM check-out guidelines...However on the last day of our stay we check out and leave our luggage with the bellman and spend the rest of that afternoon at Bentley Beach Club (included in the hotels resort fee). After a day at beach, we then return to hotel and proceed to the hotel gym to shower and change... The hotel gym is complete with mens/womans showers/amenities and towels.Time permitting you can have a lite bite at the Santorini Restaurant (Happy Hour) before going to MIA. PS..coordinate your use of the gym showers with the front desk upon check-out..",1

6806,Debbie R,Mar 2019,"Dear guest, The restaurant on premises, Santorini's by Georgios, is open to the public as well as our Beach Club Services at the Bentley Beach Club. What we do not offer unfortunately, is luggage storage due to free space limitations. Sincerely",0
6807,PAUL,Mar 2019,"I do believe they can/will assist you with bag storage. We were able to have our bags stored at 11AM, before checking in at 4:20PM with no additional costs, (Besides Tip).",0
6807,AIRPORT-OPS,Mar 2019,Luggage storage is no problem You will.need to ask hotel about use of Beach Club. If you haven't already done so then sign up for Hilton Honors. Members often get.better service and better room rates are available if you book direct with Hilton.,0
6807,Dianna G,Mar 2019,"We stayed overnight after a cruise, don‚Äôt know about daily",0
6807,Timothy C,Mar 2019,I‚Äôm not sure. I would call them because it would be a wonderful place to spend the day. They are very accommodating so they may do it. The last time I went there was after a cruise but we stayed two days. Best wishes.,0
6808,Mary R,Jan 2019,I used the Hilton friends and family travel member program since a relative works for Hilton. Still pricey but good for the location. If you search the various travel sites you can often get similar pricing discounts. I have also seen better Airbnb pricing since many of these units are privately owned and rented. I have also been hesitant to use those programs because I don't want problems that could ruin my vacation. Hilton is very responsive and trustworthy.,0
6809,Mari P,Jan 2019,I have only stayed once at this hotel but our room had no carpet & was beautifully decorated and very clean - The room we had was carpet-free - no stains anywhere,0
6809,DrEitan,Jan 2019,"Did not notice stains but the breakfast is not to par for what you would expect from Hilton. As a Diamond member, I was disappointed to find mold in the bread",0

6809,Dianna G,Jan 2019,"I don‚Äôt know where those pictures were from. Our room was beautiful (604) and all the common areas were beautiful, clean and stain free. I highly recommend this Hilton property. Beach was a short walk (maybe half a block) away down a beach path that led to boardwalk and beach. Our room included a kitchenette, large flat screen TV, shower plus huge soaking tub, bidet, balcony",0
6809,AIRPORT-OPS,Jan 2019,"Our room (city view) did not have carpet, all tiles. This was a problem as we needed to complain several times about the standard of cleaning. Floors sticky, not mopped, and balcony floor not swept until we had twice complained. As mentioned in our post, hotel has potential to be better, if standard of housekeeping improved to what we have come to expect from Hilton group hotels.",0
6809,cvjv,Jan 2019,"We didn't notice staining or much (or any) carpeting in the hotel. The hotel was clean. Our hallway and room floor was clean and tile or marble. We thought the hotel looked updated from our last trip there 2 years ago. This is our 5th stay at the Bently and we've stayed at a number of other hotels there was well. We're headed back in Feb again after our USVI stay. We had a large balcony (all rooms apparently do) and the outdoor furniture looked new and was really comfortable. Most/all the hotels (including the Bentley) in South Beach likely date back to the 50's which gives it the art decor glitz. Few hotels are new but you won't feel at all like you're in a Motel 6. Unlike the Marriott a few doors down, the Bently exterior is in pretty good shape. The Marriott obviously renovated a hotel called the Stanton and it has some exterior challenges (painted white.) We got to pick our room the day before. I recommend a high floor (we were on 9) and in the building closest to the water. We had a City view but could also see the ocean from our room. It's not the almost new South Beach St. Regis (which we stayed at 3 years ago) but you'll be happy with your choice.",0
6809,Roger A,Jan 2019,I can only say from experience. The bone visit I made last year. The room was spotlessly clean. Absolutely no complaints,0
6809,BEM63,Jan 2019,Our room had tile and everything was clean. We had three rooms in total and there wasn't anything about the hotels cleanliness that I noticed. If there had been I certainly would have said something. We will be booking again so I would recommend.,0

6810,avalanche02,Jan 2019,"This is a boutique hotel and not a resort. It is small for the Hilton standards but the location is unbeatable, it is right on the beach (amazing). Our room was a 1 bedroom suite, totally renovated with a luxury huge bathroom with Italian marble. The hotel is renovating some of the rooms. Be sure to get a good one, may be with an ocean view. The service is very good and also the Greek restaurant. The buffet breakfast was close to nothing so don't bother to include your breakfast in your rate. If you are breakfast fan you have to order a' la carte.",0

6810,BeachinSteve,Jan 2019,"Honestly, I may not be the best person to answer. Our trip was covered by my employer as a reward for my tenure and we were in a king suite. We only saw the lobby, hallways, and the suite we stayed in. It did not have any carpet at all. I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt give you any helpful information about that specifically. I will say everything we encountered was very nice and clean and the staff was excellent. They stored our luggage for hours before we checked in and after we checked out.",0
6810,Timothy C,Jan 2019,I should add that we stayed in a one bedroom suite. It is possible the regular rooms have carpet. The suites are all marble including the entire bathroom.,0
6810,Timothy C,Jan 2019,"The rooms at the Bentley Hilton are updated and beautiful. There are no carpets on the floors the floors are marble. The hotel had a nice pool and is also on the beach.

6817,rpt777,Oct 2017,"I think so, the on site resturant is an independent restaurant, (mediterranean greek food ) and it was very good. The breakfast is a buffet and it too was great with good service. I am pretty sure there was room service. I really like the hotel and the location is good. It is walking distance to the hot areas but far enough away to miss the noise and loud music when you want to escape. The beach is right there. The only down side is the parking cost, but all the hotels in this area are the same in that regard. Also can say the valet service was pretty quick when you want to go out.",-1

Unless you're bringing your own car because you have to, there really is no reason to have a car. When my wife and I were there, we did not rent a car. Everything is within walking distance. Plus, the one time we needed transportation, to visit with our son, we took Uber. My advice; don't bring a car and save the $40 per day parking and put it toward Happy Hour at the hotel! üòÑ",0
6828,colleenk1018,Aug 2016,I didn't notice if there were any self parking lots nearby but I can tell you parking anywhere in Miami can get expensive so you are likely to be better off just going with the valet. We parked over 24 hours at the Hilton and they didn't charge us more than the $40.,0

We did return and even gave some of our items to them. The pool isn't kid friendly and seems unsafe with the slippery side of it. The bathroom located near bar is by pool so I either watch for kids to get in and out. The beach an hotel located near a bar club therefore many sketchy people come through. The prices for children menus isn't shown on the restaurant menu. Not many alternatives there. They only off king beds with studio; so kids would have to sleep in a very uncomfortable sofa bed.

6835,mosaferInternational,Mar 2015,"We did not have any problems at Hilton Bently, we were treated properly and the hotel staff made sure our stay was pleasant and took great care of us. On the other hand Hilton Cabana has the most unprofessional staff, rude and not very helpful. They over book the rooms and whoever pays more gets the room. I had booked the largest suite there for December when the hotel opened ( months in advance) upon arrival there were no rooms. They had me wait in the lobby and offered me a tiny room with a cot put in for 5 people. I had booked a large suite. I refused that and they made arrangements to put us in hilton Bently and lied and said we get the same suite there. Upon arrival at Bently we were told that the suites are not large enough for that, they resolved the issue by giving us 2 rooms. They didn't have to pay for the rooms since we had to drive back and forth ( the hotels are far apart ). They made efforts to make the stay pleasant. I will definitely stay at Bently again but will NEVER EVER go to Hilton Cabana.",0
6835,Mike Q,Mar 2015,"This is this first I have heard of a manual system. I will agree that there was confusion and chaos, not a very well run Hilton. At first there was an issue with the bed in my room, then loud noise. The entire property had poor service. Nothing to do with a computer.",0
6835,Sheena Maclean,Mar 2015,"Not sure this was to do with me - the only contact during my stay with Michelle was to do with the day rate for our room,as our flight wasn't until 10pm & an agreed rate had been agreed with the office manager the previous day - this hadn't been conveyed to Michelle & she was insisting upon a higher rate - the misunderstanding was quickly remedied & didnt detract from our stay at the hotel,as my review probably suggests. As i mentioned,i don't think the above 'incident'relates to myself,as no complaint was even thought of & no personal note from Michelle required or received ...hope this clarifies matters.",0
6836,Reveti,Feb 2015,"I would recommend the stretch from Pensacola beach to Panama City in Florida. They are the whitest prettiest beaches you will find in the U.S. and many areas are fairly private. I live in Pensacola and have been to The Hilton Bentley last year. The hotel is phenomenal, as well is the nightlife but the beaches have nothing on ours.",0
6836,MickyO,Feb 2015,"We were at the Bentley in August of 2014. Then, it was a quiet, uncrowded beach. But, not many people go to Miami in August due to the heat. And was it hot!! The water was clear and much like all of the Atlantic on the east coast. It was not the crystal clear blue of the Caribbean at all. But, the hotel is very lovely and we loved the balcony overlooking the water. I would go back for sure, but not in August!",0
6836,Louis D,Feb 2015,"Miami beach is meticulously cared for by the city. It is honestly one of the nicest beaches you will find anywhere. Sand is not white, but quite bright and very clean. The water is very clear & nothing like the Atlantic up north. It is not quite the Caribbean, but quite lovely. Like most of the hotels, the Bentley has it's designated area full of beach chairs w/ cushions. Like all of the hotels, they will charge you a daily ""resort"" fee, which gets you 2 chairs and an umbrella. That's just standard practice. In all, you will not be disappointed in the quality of the beach. If you're looking for a quiet, lonely beach, however, you are headed to the wrong location.",0

6837,Johnv1231939,Oct 2014,"Yes there is and its $35 a night. Anywhere on South Beach or Miami Beach they are going to charge for parking, best bet is to leave car on the outer rings and use a taxi to get into South Beach, depending on how long your staying you will save money.",0

6847,Jim S,Oct 2015,"In front of the majority of the hotels along Collins, you'll see two small black/blue metal signs for the valet company (same signs for all the boutique hotels). Typically they'll have 2-3 empty spaces between those signs. When you pull into one of those spaces, a valet will take the car. I think we paid $35 for 24 hours. It takes 30-35 minutes for them to retrieve our car, so call ahead for pick up. They must take the cars pretty far away, as in the morning, they have a guy that drives around to pick up the valet guys after you get your car (hence the 30 minutes to retrieve the car). On our first trip, we thought each hotel had a valet service, but rather it's a shared service by all the smaller hotels. Agree with another poster's info -- there is a great small public lot just down the street. On Sat afternoon, we couldn't find a space in there -- and there were 10 others waiting on spaces -- took forever to get in and out of the lot). There are also metered spaces along the road. Not sure how either works in terms of paying, cost, etc. -- but none were available when we were there on a Sat afternoon.",1
6847,Mauricio P,Oct 2015,"There is the paid valet service, which is not much more expensive than parking it yourself in one of the nearby parking lots if you are planning to leave your car parked most of the time. For short time parking, there is a public parking lot just by the corner. If you are really on the saving money thing, I guess there are some parking spots where you don't have to pay for the night, but you have to wake up early in the morning to avoid getting a ticket.",0

6862,willow73,Mar 2018,No onsite parking at any of the Art Deco hotels along Ocean Drive. There are several municipal parking garages but they are not typically overnight.

The comments that were posted regarding the parking garage next door were most likely referring to their per day rate, which is higher than other area garages due to the fact that they are privately owned rather than owned and regulated by the City of Miami Beach.

6920,Achimmah,Apr 2017,I pre-paid for one night and determined to pay for the second night upon checkout. Taxes are identified on most lodging websites so that should not be a surprise. The hotel does charge $35.00/ night if you decide to use the valet service. Self parking can be a pain if you need to circle the area for a vacant spot (and you still have to pay to park. We found our stay to be fabulous and worth every penny. You can stay at other properties and pay substantially more; but get considerably less. I wouldn't hesitate about staying at the Marlin. The best of luck.....,0

6920,Kathleen H,Apr 2017,"We did not have any additional charges, but we flew in and took a shuttle to hotel. I'm sure there may be a parking fee if you drive your own car, as parking is at a premium there. The breakfast, which was a little more than continental, was totally free, and very welcomed before we left for port. They have a restaurant for any dinners that may be pricey, but ALL restaurants in South Beach are pricey! Be aware that we bought a Margarita at a cafe on South Beach, and it cost $25! The larger ""bowl"" size that everyone was drinking was $39!! But at the hotel bar, I think we paid Happy Hour prices for a Mojito and a beer.",0

6959,Mari C,Aug 2018,it all depends on if they have a room available when u check in if not it will be a couple hours before 4 or after four no red to worry u can use all the amenities there while u wait and there are plenty of places to eat they also have great lounge chairs to sit and relax put your feet up try the front pouch there restaurant its amazing food there,0
6959,Susan I,Aug 2018,We were told our room would be ready for 4pm still had to wait until after 5pm to get to room. We were very disappointed as tired after long flight.,0
6959,J S,Aug 2018,I doubt they will agree to a 5 am checkin without paying for that night before- that's if they even had a room. They will take your bags and store them. Go have some breakfast. Walk around. Hit the beach early and they will call t pl u when your room is ready,0
6959,yamariae,Aug 2018,I got there around noon and room wasn‚Äôt ready until about 1 or 2. But as said previously you can leave your bags and go hang out.,0
6959,Nikkitacal,Aug 2018,No way. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any hotel that will allow that. You can leave your bags and go play for the day and probably get checked in at 1 or 2.,0

6970,nunlikeme P,Nov 2017,"Like every one else says, It has a partial ocean view (for a extra cost). The hotel does give you chairs for the beach and towels. You can walk to the beach (its across the street) and your on the strip where the other restaurant and bars are.",1
6970,Teejay N,Oct 2017,"You can see that the ocean is nearby when you look from the rooftop in some of the PH suites, not a full view of the ocean. The location is ideal for the beach & night life.",1
6970,Una Lee,Oct 2017,"The room I stayed in on the 3rd floor does not have ocean view. Maybe the penthouse rooms do, but I doubt it. However the hotel is very close to the ocean (a block away). It is also close to the ""night life"" area (Art Deco district). Both are a short walk away, about 5-10 min. The location of this hotel cannot be beat.",1
6970,flightaway24,Oct 2017,"Hi, Lolopfitz has resume it perfectly. You not directly on the beach. you work 4 minutes and you there. Just look at google maps and go street view, you will see. It is more calm on that part of south beach but you just a few minute from the night life, so it perfect.",1
6970,dlbork,Oct 2017,"If you book a Penthouse Roof Terrace, there's a pretty good view of the ocean. There's a 15 story condo directly in front of the hotel (in between the hotel and the beach). But the rooftop rooms at the front of the hotel (we are in Room 11) had nice views of the ocean. The hotel is in the heart of the nightlife.",1
6970,Maxwell M,Oct 2017,It‚Äôs not located directly ocean front. Some of the rooms do have a partial ocean view as in you can see a sliver of water. The location is the best you can get in South Beach for night life. Have fun!,1
6970,esthercbuenosaires,Dec 2017,"Yes! I am not sure about the ocean view, but you are just in the beach so I guess that it depends on the room you get. About the nightlife, you will definitely be there",0
6970,TKpets,Nov 2017,We had to walk down a street and between two other hotels to get to the ocean.. so I'm going to say maybe one side and upper floors,0
6970,DaphneTraveler,Nov 2017,Hi there No the hotel does not have ocean views as it is one block back from the beach. It is pretty close to nightlife depending on what you want to do. If you don‚Äôt mind walking - we Australians walk a fair bit - everything is within walking distance or an inexpensive cab fare away. Cheers,0
6970,agolfer1256,Nov 2017,The hotel is actually across the street from the ocean---it is right in the action of nightlife of south beach---,0
6970,KjunCelt,Nov 2017,I agree with the others. No view. Great location.,0
6970,lolopfitz,Oct 2017,"There are some ocean views but honestly during the day you will probably be at the beach instead of looking at it from the hotel!!! We actually always get the city view because when we bring our son, we like to sit out on the balcony and watch all of the action on Collins Ave. It is within walking distance to all of the nightlife on Ocean Dr. Some of the clubs that are not on Ocean dr you will need to take a taxi or hail a freebee (download the app) but still only a few bucks. It is a great location, has a great restaurant downstairs, starbucks across the street, shops everywhere, etc.",0
6971,esthercbuenosaires,Aug 2017,"Hi, it is directly on the beach; you only have to cross the street -Ocean Drive- and you are there. And also: the rate includes the beach service. And it is a nice part of the beach",1

6972,ZOcean1437,Jan 2018,Yes we are family friendly,0
6972,lolopfitz,Oct 2017,Yes definitely. We have been staying here for years and our son is now 12. He loves that he can come back from the beach and swim some more in the pool and he loves hanging out on the balcony and watching the world go by. There are definitely certain times of the year when you don't want to bring your family here period because of the rowdiness but those times are less than a hand full.,1
6972,esthercbuenosaires,Aug 2017,"I went with my husband. I remember seeing kids in the hotels, though not many, Anyway the beach is very nice and they have a good swimming pool in the fist floor.",1
6972,Little Piggy,Aug 2017,"It definitely caters to all ages. The bar area adjacent to reception has a play and entertainment area great for couples and families. The beach is only a short walk away. The rooms are spacious and have multiple amenities catering to discerning interests. There is a Senor Frog bar across the street that may get noisy but aside from that, it is definitely the place to have a great time!",1

There is also a nice outside inside garden room where there is plenty of space and for the parents to sit and watch and have a drink. A lovely restaurant attached to the hotel great for breakfast. Try and go to the managers evening on a certain night, free canopies and drinks and a chance to talk to all departments heads. The hotel is perfectly located to beach and all amenities you will enjoy",1
6972,Pete_Coach,Aug 2017,Yes. I saw a number families. The room we had contained a small kitchenette.The proximity to the beach and small stores and shops makes it a great family hotel,1

La Flora is centrally located on Collins Avenue between 12th and 13th streets, just steps from the beautiful beaches of South Beach and within walking distance of all shops, restaurants, and nightlife that South Beach is famous for.

7072,Caioflucio,Apr 2015,"Ol√° Roseli! O hotel somente disponibiliza toalha de praia. Guarda-sol e cadeira vc pode encontrar na praia, por√©m n√£o recomendo pois √© muito caro, em torno de 15 d√≥lares cada um por aluguel, compensa at√© mais comprar uma e usar todos os dias do que alugar na praia. N√£o acho que compensa, sugiro que vc leve somente uma toalha de praia pra estender na areia. Abs, Caio",1
7073,BB@B,Apr 2015,Taxi from Miami airport direct to hotel is a flat fare of $35 .,0
7074,BB@B,Apr 2015,Obrigado por sua pergunta e da forma direta mais f√°cil seria de t√°xi $ 35 de taxa fixa e n√£o deve demorar mais do que 30 minutos. Obrigado por escolher o La Flora e estamos ansiosos para a sua estadia. Ms. Ros Gottuso GM,1
7074,Lucinia C,Apr 2015,Se reservar um carro o pessoal do hotel indica um estacionamento coberto pertinho do hotel que o pre√ßo √© bem legal em compara√ß√£o com os demais.,0
7074,Lucinia C,Apr 2015,"Ol√°, eu reservei um carro e do aeroporto at√© o hotel √™h perto deu vinte minutos. S√≥ que foi bem cedo sem tr√¢nsito. Miami tem um tr√¢nsito razo√°vel. Acho que taxi da certo sim. Espero ter ajudado.",0
7074,AMauch66,Apr 2015,"Bom dia, Ricardo. Naquela localiza√ß√£o n√£o precisa de carro para nada. D√° para fazer tudo a p√©. Portanto, n√£o recomendaria alugar carro, a n√£o ser que tua programa√ß√£o seja n√£o ficar somente ali por South Beach. Do aeroporto de Miami at√© o La Flora, fica mais em conta pegar um ""t√°xi compartilhado"" de alguma dessas empresas (go airport suttle, super shuttle, etc.).",0
7074,Ruy Wanderley C,Apr 2015,"Sim, pode ser o t√°xi. Mas o melhor mesmo √© alugar um carro, que dependendo dos deslocamentos previstos pode at√© ser mais em conta, al√©m do conforto. Ressalto que em alguns lugares n√£o observei a exist√™ncia de t√°xi facilmente, al√©m das dist√¢ncias, que s√£o grandes. Particularmente ao La Flora, nas proximidades h√° mais de uma loja do Wallgreens, bons restaurantes - ao lado h√° o Spiga, 10! - e lanchonetes, al√©m do √≥bvio existente na Ocean Drive. Se alugares um carro, opte pelo estacionamento municipal que fica bem pr√≥ximo ao hotel, mormente o pre√ßo de l√° ser melhor que o do servi√ßo de vallet oferecido pelo La Flora.",0
7074,Camcardoso,Apr 2015,"Ricardo, sim, vc pode ir de t√°xi do aeroporto at√© o hotel La Flora. Se a sua perman√™ncia em Miami Beach for prolongada ou se vc pretende visitar outras cidades, o melhor √© alugar um ve√≠culo. √â muito pr√°tico e f√°cil faze-lo nos USA. O Hotel La Flora n√£o possui parque de estacionamento, mas possui servi√ßo de Vallet Parking e existe parque de estacionamento publico ao lado do hotel e outro na esquina da 13th Street (a 50m do hotel). Este √∫ltimo tem a vantagem de ser coberto.",0
7074,Maria Beatriz Lobo,Apr 2015,"Acho que depende muito de quantos dias e o que vc vai fazer em Miami. Apesar da dificuldade de estacionar, o LA Flora tem um estacionamento ao lado! Entretanto, como ele fica no cora√ß√£o de South Beach muita coisa se faz a p√©! Para ir aos principais outlets fora de Miami h√° confucoes em conta que te pegam no hotel. Se vc n√£o pretende sair muito da regi√£o ou ficar poucos dias, eu ficar√≠a de taxi (que l√° tem toda hora). Para valer a pena alugar um carro vc deve imaginar que ter√° que gastar mais de U$120 por dia de taxi (imaginando que ao custo do carro se soma seguro, estacionamento e combust√≠vel), A boa not√≠cia √© que vc tem as duas op√ß√µes! Em outros lugares de Miami taxi n√£o √© t√£o facil!",0
7074,Lari_B,Apr 2015,"Sempre q fiquei em Miami aluguei um carro. O hotel nao tem estacionamento, mas tem vallet e tem um estacionamento pr√≥ximo. O carro √© s√≥ retirar e devolver no aeroporto mesmo; tem MUITAS empresas l√° e √© bem f√°cil. A √∫ltima vez aluguei o carro pela √Ålamo pelo site e chegando l√° o processo √© bem simples.",0
7075,BB@B,Jan 2015,Thank you for your question regarding smoking areas - La Flora Hotel is strictly Non Smoking ... when you are searching for hotels always check the smoking box which will give you a better option.,0
7076,BB@B,Aug 2014,yes all rooms have safes !,0
7080,LydiaAnnC,Jan 2022,"Yes they have blow dryers and flat irons. If you have other hotel options in the area, suggest you choose them. The hotel has very limited rooms available due to many floors under construction. If you have any issue with your room, such as you are on the Soho Beach side and can‚Äôt sleep with the loud music vibrating the walls most of the night, or if something doesn‚Äôt work in your room, you are probably out of luck to get a different room. Limited staff is available so the kitchen closes at odd hours for pool service. You are far from any other restaurants on the beach I‚Äôd you can‚Äôt order from your hotel.",0
7082,InnerBanksGary,Jun 2019,"Sorry, I don't follow. You mean like the pool or the beach? Those come with the deal.",0
7083,Angela M,Dec 2018,The guest manager hides in his office. All employees are from different nations. Being Greek I clicked with them. I have the owners name and telephone number but I have to look where I put it. Everybtime you will call it will always be someone front the Front Desknor an insignificant manager. Are you aware that parking is the list $40 daily? It‚Äôs a nice hotel and the staff are very accommodating. Feel free to ask more. I don‚Äôt recommend Miami Beach.,1
7083,Real_in_NYC,Jan 2019,No. I don't have he number. The problem is that most of the employees I encountered didn't speak English. Try calling the sales department.,0
7083,Danitra B,Dec 2018,"I tried calling the hotel directly several times and the front desk staff ALWAYS intercepts the call. I asked a simple question and the front desk staff confirmed my reservation, I told her that was not what I was calling for. Smh....",0
7083,Lynne T,Dec 2018,I would say just call the hotel and ask to speak to the manager.,0
7083,Remeella,Dec 2018,Call the hotel directly,0
7084,GailNYC,Mar 2018,They don't officially hv their own beach. You need to rent from some random concession,0
7085,Stefanie T,Jan 2018,"There is a public lot about a block south of the hotel on the other side. I am not sure of the cost but that would probably be your best bet. There is very, very limited street parking on the side streets, which are metered.",1
7085,BookyNancy,Jan 2018,We ended up parking at the hotel and paying the $36/night. There is very limited parking in the area and we didn't find much of anything available. Try looking ahead before you travel for a better deal. We didn't and regretted it!,1
7086,mamidon,Jul 2018,Here at the Four Points we have our own valet parking which has a fixed price per day of $40.44 which includes taking the car out as many times as you like a day.,0
7087,Mark M,Jan 2018,"There were no incidental fees from what I remember, but there were definitely resort fees,but I don‚Äôt remember the cost, but it was the amount quoted by the hotel, before I booked. There were no surprises.",1

7098,Cristina A,Oct 2016,It's really close to the beach u can walk there also their beach chairs are free most of places they charge 10 dollars for each chair,0
7099,Gerson_So,Jul 2016,They receive packages but charge a fee for each one. In my case it was still worth it.,1
7099,prodigy978,Jul 2016,I don't know the answer specifically but I've never hear of a hotel that wouldn't accept a package on days when you are a guest. I'd followup with guest services and they could tell you what to put on the address.,0
7099,boobot1,Jul 2016,What type of purchases? The hotel room can be paid online.,0
7100,Mike A A,Jan 2016,"I am sorry, I cannot help. My room did have a refrigerator but I do not know if this applies for all rooms.",0

7102,Keeks02,Oct 2015,Yes or you can take an Uber!,1
7102,Lucia R,Oct 2015,"Yes, they did help me with that :) not reception, but the bell boys right next to the reception area. It's where your packages are held (if you send any). We had an issue with target and had to get a cab at 8pm and they helped us through :) there's still a lot of taxis right on the door though. If you want a private car, I got a couple of numbers from them.",1
7102,maggie0500,Oct 2015,Yes they would be happy to help. But there are taxis outside the hotel which are approved taxis not just any old cars.,0
7103,Family-Travels3,Aug 2015,"Both available but at $30 for valet per day and $27 for self park, go for the valet. Also parking is not far, but long traffic que around the hotel as it is part of a one way system",0
7104,mimis2,Jun 2015,"It is a personal preference, however they park the car at the parking lot across the street, literally. You get the ticket stamped/signed that you were a guest to get the discounted price. It's the same exact parking lot, and they take forever to get the cars back, and they wven damaged a new one (I know this as i was waiting outside one day). We parked ourselves, it was a waste to give valet the money. Just know that the hotel will not stamp your ticket without you asking them.",1
7104,BCTravel091,Jun 2015,"Confirming what others have said, self park will be more expensive and more trouble. Street parking is very limited in that area. Valet is the best option.",0
7104,Family-Travels3,Jun 2015,"There is self parking, the valet will give you directions as it's not at the hotel",0
7104,sandiw08,Jun 2015,They told us self park was in and out 1 time per day and valet parking is as many as needed.,0
7104,BobMinchak,Jun 2015,"You can always look for street parking, but it is scarce, less secure and there is always the potential for a ticket. Maybe the only thing worse than traffic in Miami Beach is parking. The valet is reliable, quick and the easiest way to leave the car.",0
7104,rockstarmama,Jun 2015,We parked in the municipal garage about 4-5 blocks away for $8 overnight.,0
7104,m21are,Jun 2015,It's the only option,0
7104,Lucia R,Jun 2015,"I think there is ony valet parking (35$ last time I went), and it's complimentary, so it should be possible to self-park.You still need to pay around 25$ per day though.",0
7105,Tom B,Jun 2015,You will need to contact the hotel with your request.,0
7105,franchescaG,Jun 2015,I would suggest that you speak to the hotel directly. I found the front desk staff very helpful regards franchescag,0
7106,mamidon,Jun 2015,We offer complimentary towels and chaise poolside. The hotel does not offer these services on the beach as it does not belong to us and is operated by a concession to the city. We look forward to your arrival.,0
7107,Ana T,Mar 2015,La suite a la que fuimos no tenia pero por un costo menor te instalan una. No recuerdo el costo pero creo fueron usd 20 o 30.- Suerte!,0
7108,Larry K,Dec 2014,"As I recall, the breakfast buffet was around $12 per person. It was good enough. We came by car so I do not know the taxi fare from the airport. Cost to park was $25 per night.",1
7109,og842014,Nov 2014,"I am not sure whether you are talking about the city center of Miami Beach (to the south, for example, Lincoln Road, a major dining and shopping destination, is within a medium walk, and only a few minutes by car) or the city center of Miami, which is further away, across the causeway and not what I would consider to be within walking distance unless you are a serious athlete interesting in getting a lot of exercise. If you want to be in or near the city center of Miami, there are closer options, for example the Hilton, which is very well located and offers great views.",1
7110,KISH60763,Nov 2014,"No change in hotel,the chairs and umbrellas on the beach is from a private company and they do charge possible 10 to 12 dollars .I never use them I use the hotel pool..OK.",1
7110,RandusFonseca,Nov 2014,"Hi, there is no resort charge, but they use to charge for chairs and unbrellas separatelly, I guess it is made by an independent company if I'm not wrong they charge $ 10 to $ 20 for chairs with umbrellas.",1
7110,Ana T,Mar 2015,"La piscina del hotel da a la playa donde puedes llevar las toallas que te entregan. Es simplemente pasar un puentecito y un caminito de madera. No te dan sillas ni sombrillas. En la playa los alquilan pero a alto costo. No nos pareci√≥ que valiera la pena. Disfrutamos de las reposeras, sombrillas y piscinas del hotel y cuando queriamos nos ibamos a dar un ba√±o al mar. El hotel cuenta con jacuzzi para unas 15 personas afuera tambi√©n!! Disfruten!!",0
7110,JakeDublin,Dec 2014,Beach yes. 10 dollars. Pool no.,0

7111,KISH60763,Nov 2014,I think they have a safe deposit in the hotel I never used it but generally Sheratons hotels always have safe deposit security box.,1
7111,Larry K,Nov 2014,As I recall there was a small safe in the closed of our room. You may want to call the hotel to ensure that is the case for all rooms.,1

El desayuno en el hotel es caro, pero hay cafeteras en el hotel, y tb en la habitacion, ademas hielo en todos los pisos, a mi criterio hay que caminar hasta la 41 (son dos cuadras) y ahi hay un donking donuts, bien y barato... sino en la esquina hay un barcito. No hay servicio de playa, podes usar las toallas del hotel y si quieres alquilar sombrilla y reposera en la playa misma. La pileta climatizada al aire libre es espectacular y abierta 24 horas. Si vas a alojarte aqu√≠ recomiendo asociarte por internet al hotel (al grupo empresario) ya que por ser miembro accedes a ofertas como ser dos noches gratis cada 4, es muy conveniente. Suerte!",1
7132,markguillermovih,Jul 2016,Hola el hotel si tiene desayuno y es muy bueno. Tiene valet parking que esta en unos 35 usd si mal no recuerdo. Tened toallas y las sombrillas y sillas las puedes alquilar en la playa por 20 usd. Saludos,1

7132,AnastasiaMtz,Jul 2016,"Hola sobre el estacionamiento realmente lo desconozco , te puedo mensionar que si tiene acceso a la playa , que en la zona de la alberca te entregan toallas. El desayuno no esta incluido el hotel ofrece en cortesia cafe , pero cuenta con un restaurante que ofrece desayuno buffet por 16 usd con fee, o a la carta . Cualquer de las 2 opciones son muy buenas . Si te gusta caminar podras dar una buena caminata y llegar al corazond e la Ocean Drive , Quizas regresar de una buena cena y ayudara a la digestion , un taxi te cobrara aproximadamente 14 usd .",0

Tuvimos inconvenientes con la reserva que hicimos directamente con sheraron y los gerentes de turno no se hicieron cargo. Lamentable. Rozando la discriminacion x no hablar perfecto ingl√©s.

7134,adrianaocchi,Nov 2016,"Hola batani35, el aire acondicionado se puede regular en la habitaci√≥n pero al salir de ella , en pasillos, lobby, sal√≥n desayunador es tan baja que ten√©s fr√≠o hasta con campera, la cual como mencion√©, luego ten√©s que llevar todo el d√≠a y es una carga innecesaria. Para que la recepcionista del sal√≥n desayunador tenga una estufa el√©ctrica a su lado por el excesivo aire acondicionado, es un hotel que no le importa el derroche de energ√≠a, ni que los hu√©spedes est√©n inc√≥modos al igual que la mayor√≠a de sus empleados. Unos pocos desayunaban en el hotel y hablando con ellos dec√≠an que era por el aire acondicionado. No tuvieron en cuenta los reclamos efectuados en recepci√≥n.

7200,Maximo S,Aug 2015,"Dear Irene & Zan, We will be honored to welcome you to the Albion hotel! South Beach is a busy neighborhood, stores, restaurants and shops are open late every day. We would say it is safe in comparison with other cities but we would always recommend you to pay attention to your surroundings. (This would apply for any City in the world) In both cases you would need to take more than one bus to arrive to destination. We would recommend a taxi. Check out time is 12.00 noon if the room is available upon departure, a late check out would be possible at an extra cost (This would depend on the time of the departure) Public transportation in Miami is best if you are traveling short distances but if the idea is to travel outside South Beach we would recommend you other options such as a taxi. We also offer tours to the before mentioned locations. For more information please do not hesitate to contact our concierge +305-913-1007 As you might imagine there are many areas in Miami Beach for snorkeling and diving. In South beach, South Pointe Park. Key West, three hours away from Miami it is naturally beautiful and a great option too. Warm Regards The Albion Team",0

7200,Ian A,Aug 2015,"We found it a safe place to be out late on an evening, but like any city you should still be careful. Public transport in Miami and Florida area is a bit limited, there are ways of getting round but it won't always be close to a bus or train station. Hire card or taxis are the most popular form of transport. Late check out will probably be charged for but you can leave luggage to collect later free of charge. Best place to snorkel is the Florida Keys. South of Miami and a wonderful place to visit. Organised snorkelling trips are readily available and the visibility and amount of sea life in the Keys is very good. Many people visit Florida and don't go to the Keys, in my opinion they are missing the best bit.",0

7272,agolfer1256,Nov 2017,The hotel is actually across the street from the ocean---it is right in the action of nightlife of south beach---,0
7272,KjunCelt,Nov 2017,I agree with the others. No view. Great location.,0
7272,lolopfitz,Oct 2017,"There are some ocean views but honestly during the day you will probably be at the beach instead of looking at it from the hotel!!! We actually always get the city view because when we bring our son, we like to sit out on the balcony and watch all of the action on Collins Ave. It is within walking distance to all of the nightlife on Ocean Dr. Some of the clubs that are not on Ocean dr you will need to take a taxi or hail a freebee (download the app) but still only a few bucks. It is a great location, has a great restaurant downstairs, starbucks across the street, shops everywhere, etc.",0

7291,Ashley B,Apr 2016,"I disagree. You will be dissapointed with the city view. Seeing ocean drive, the waves, the palm trees is well worth the extra money. Ask for a room near the end of the hall or a corner room and your view will be unobstructed .....you will LOVE this hotel but the terrace suite brings it to another level :)",0

En el msimo aeropuerto puede tomar un shuttle, con tarifa fija (entre $20 y $30), un Uber (entre $10 y $15) o un taxi ($25 o mas).

One major tip though...ask for a room as far from the lifts as possible. üëçüëçüëç",0
7639,Andrea O,Aug 2014,"I was there in July and the staff said pool would not be ready until October. The rooms are newly redone. You do not need to rent a car at this hotel the location is that good. Parking can be anywhere from $15-$35 a day, so it is not worth it and you can get cabs anywhere if you do not want to walk. The location is what this place has going for it and that is all. The hotel is beachfront and you can use the pool and beach umbrellas ,chairs for free at the hotel next door which is only a few steps away. I booked on Hotwire in the blind and got a great price but was not aware of the pool situation until after I booked.",0

En cuanto a ir al Sawgrass el hotel no dispone del traslado. Si hay una representante de una agencia que te contrata el servicio, con un costo por pasajero y horario de salida y regreso predeterminado. Va pasando por diferentes hoteles, lo comento para calcular el tiempo de aprovechamiento del paseo de compras -el lugar es enorme y alejado-.- Si es un grupo opino que conviene un taxi, contratado desde el hotel para que no te paseen y cobren demasiado. As√≠ hicimos nosotros que fuimos tres, con el mismo conductor acordamos el regreso llamandolo al celular cuando quisimos volver.

7692,Etienne,Sep 2018,"Even though it‚Äôs really a nice hotel, I recommend going for another hotel. The rooms are like apartments and the rooftop pool is the only one they have.

Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral an einem der wichtigsten Orte Miamis, deshalb habt ihr Gl√ºck, denn es gibt verschiedene M√∂glichkeiten. Vorschlag 1, ihr mietet euch einen Mietwagen, so haben wir es gemacht, da kann man echt viel sehen, u.a. nach Key West fahren, Richtung Norden nach fort Lauderdale... beides sehr empfehlenswert. Alternativ gibt es die M√∂glichkeit ganz normal mit dem Taxi zu fahren, allerdings kostet hier eine Fahrt zwischen 30-40$. Meine Empfehlung daher: haltet die Augen offen nach sog. Shuttels, die stehen auch oft am Flughafen da kommt ihr recht g√ºnstig und schnell zu verschiedenen Punkten in Miami. u.a. gibt es da den ‚ÄûMiami Beach Airport Flyer"" oder dem ""Supershuttle"" f√ºr ca.22$. Googlet einfach mal nach den zwei Begriffen, dann werdet ihr was finden. Mein tipp dennoch: ein Mietwagen lohnt sich in Florida jedoch mehr denn es glbt soo viel zu sehen! Ich w√ºnsche euch einen sch√∂nen urlaub.",1

Otra opci√≥n es conectarte a trav√©s de Facebook . Lo bueno de Booking que suele tener tarifas especiales (nosotros lo usamos as√≠). Pero podr√≠as intentar directo y comparar. Voy a buscar el detalle de los administradores y te lo paso. Por el sol en la playa : estuve en Junio y ning√∫n problema el edificio no es muy alto (comparando con los de Sunny island por ejemplo, all√≠ si hay sombra temprano) y al estar a unos metro de la playa no hay problema de sombra. Inclu√≠da en la tarifa est√° el fit: uso del servicio de playa (reposeras s√∫per c√≥modas, carpas y sombrilla!!) √©ste servicio por lo general se cobra aparte o independiente del hotel en Miami y suele ser muy caro , ac√° est√° inclu√≠do y es excelente!!! (y las personas que est√°n en el puesto de playa siempre son muy amables).

F√≠jate donde dice (en la reserva) ""quiere comunicarse con el administrador""(o algo as√≠) y le pod√©s preguntar. El apartamento cuenta con elementos para limpieza, toallas para reponer y s√°banas.

7859,4globetrotters4,Feb 2019,There is still some construction. It is not as noisy as last year. You still must walk through the employee section to get to the pool. The pool that is open is great and has a waterfall and 2 hot tubs. The lobby has been remodeled and it is no longer shabby as some reviewers have stated.,0

If you don't have beach weather on Christmas day and you want to shop, check out the Festival Flea Market Mall in Pompano Beach. They are open Christmas day and have an adjoining Antique Mall, which is fun.",0
7867,4globetrotters4,May 2017,"the construction on the south side of the building is complete including new balconies and glass railings. The upper pool and pool deck is still incomplete, however, the lower pool is usable. There is some construction noise and demolition on the north side of the building but they don't do any work on the weekends. I hope this helps if you are planning to stay there be sure you get a room on the southside of the building which are the odd numbers but stay away from the first two units in the front which would end in an 01 or an 03 because they may not be completely finished",1

7870,Merlyn S,Nov 2016,I had a junior suite with two rooms and teo bath,0
7871,Lesley220,Nov 2016,Obviously I have no idea whether the construction will be finished on schedule or not but I would definitely contact the hotel directly & I would suggest you get any confirmation of completion in writing. I would hate for your celebrations to be marred & certainly when we were there in August it was totally and utterly a building site - on arrival there was a builder working on our balcony which was covered in rubble. All our windows had blue film on them & I was genuinely staggered the hotel thought it was acceptable to remain open during such extensive renovations. I hope it is completed & you have a great trip but please check first - don't let it ruin your holiday like it did ours.,2
7871,Veronica Q,Nov 2016,I was able to use the pool but that was 3 months ago. We really enjoyed this hotel though.,1
7871,Jonathan K,Nov 2016,First of all Happy Almost Birthday to you! Second of all for such an awesome birthday you should not have to stress about where you're going to stay. I'm usually pretty tolerant but this place needs a major upgrade and you should not have to deal with it while you're staying there. I would definitely recommend picking a different place even if it cost you a few more dollars per night you'll be much happier in the end. Also highly recommend Havana 1957 for a great Cuban restaurant when you're in Miami you'll have lots of fun!,1
7871,vasco q,Jan 2017,When we were there there was some construction but the staff was clear and accommodating,0
7871,sheila p,Nov 2016,How many people will be in party?,0
7871,Kerry B,Nov 2016,Thanks for your responses. Have tried numerous times to contact the hotel but they have not responded to either my emails or FB messages. Will try to telephone from Aus and see what response I get. We will be out and about during the day so not too worried about noise - more so the loss of facilities like the pool and outdoor bar/restaurant. :),0
7871,bsd2013,Nov 2016,I can't answer as I was there during construction and noise but pool was available. Can't you contact the hotel directly?,0
7871,516brian,Nov 2016,I would NOT take the chance. My advise is to find another place.,0

7875,Samuel R,Jun 2016,I had my 2 year old son with me. It is ok and safe. The parking you must use the parking lot. There is a charge but not outrageous. You have to download it on your phone the app and pay every 4 hours or so and it is a flat rate overnight after a certain time. I believe it was about $15-$20 per day or so. It was 2 years ago so rates may have increased slightly.,1

7879,Bykins,Apr 2016,I'm afraid I don't know the correct answer to your question but I think that a young woman who works at the front desk and is exceedingly helpful will be able to assist you. Her name is Nubia Palma and the front desk number is: (305) 865-6500. It could also be that the agent rather than the hotel has something to do with the delay but as I said I'm not sure and I don't want to give you incorrect information.,0

Nosotros dejamos el auto una noche en el hotel y luego nos dimos cuenta de esto y lo sacamos, avisamos en recepcion y al valet que ya no lo dejariamos y nos dijeron que con solo no dejarlo era suficiente porque no iban a figurar las noche, pero al irnos querian cobrarnos todas las noches!!! Nosotros reservamos por Boocking y nos incluia el desayuno ( que es carisimo, como unos U$S 35 el buffet) y en la cuenta final tambien querian cobrarnoslo!!!

Al final se aclararon todos los cargos, pero si no estas atento y guardas recibos y demas, esto puede amargarte la ultima ma√±ana!!! incluso nos habian anotado una cena en el restaurante con un cargo de U$S 25 ( una risa porque ni un agua cuesta eso, un filete sale unos U$S 50) ese cargo tambien lo quitaron!!! Te recomiendo para cenar, el restaurante "" Lola"" de un hotel cercano a unas 5 cuadras, es de argentinos, el lugar es lindisimo, el ambiente divino, la comida muy buena y no te digo que es barato, pero habremos gstado unos U$S 100 en una cena para dos, con plato gourmet, botella de vino, postre y propina Te paso el dato : Oceanside Plaza Condo, 5555 Collins Av Miami Beach, FL 33140 (305) 397-8848 otro sitio lindo y no caro para cenar en la calle Espa√±ola Wey es Flame, ahi comimos muy bien ( no es tan elegante) y gastamos bastante menos 447 Espanola Way Miami Beach FL Ojala te sirvan los consejos y buenas vacaciones!!! No se claven con los copones gigantes de margaritas y daikiris que vana ver tomando a todos en Ocean drive porque salen una fortuna!!! U$S 45 .... pregunten primero!!!",0

8017,Turner N,Feb 2016,"My wife and I requested a noise free room. They originally gave us a room over the air conditioning units which were very noisy. It was also over the bars and party areas. Very loud through out the night. Then came the garbage trucks early in the morning with the clanging go the dumpsters. Ask for Natalli if you can't get served at the front desk. Thos rooms cost more, but are worth a good night's rest.",0

8017,Jim H,Feb 2016,"Have a great time! The Breakwater has accomodations in two building next to each other ... the building where you check in is considered to have the quieter rooms, the adjacent building is on the corner of 10th .. across 10th is the Clevelander Bar, which is fun, but can get loud! That's why the Breakwater rooms in that building are less quiet.",0

8018,blackheath2,Feb 2016,"I fully agree with the previous two answers. Don't bother trying to find a vacant spot on the street, especially during the week-end. There are some parking garages but they are 4-5 blocks away. If you can afford to stay at the Breakwater, you should be able to afford the $42 charge plus valet tip.",0

The problem was that they moved all the towels even not laying on the floor (so not to be replaced) and leaving just one shower towel or one face towel. What sense???",0

8041,galegopalma,Sep 2017,"el desayuno es horroroso, nada de boller√≠a, ni un croissant, muffin, Magdalena, apenas fruta, zumo de brick, caf√© mal√≠simo y personal antip√°tico, pues un d√≠a se hab√≠a agotado el az√∫car y ped√≠ para mi caf√© y uno de los chicos me dijo que no hab√≠a m√°s, a lo cual le respond√≠, como no va a haber m√°s az√∫car en un hotel, ni que fuera caviar, luego otra chica me trajo az√∫car solo hay huevos revueltos, salchichas, unas tostadas grasientas y yogur natural, mejor ve desayunar fuera aunque tengas que pagar. y no tiene acceso directo a playa pues est√° en ocean Drive, tienes que cruzar la calle y luego caminar un poco. si est√° frente a la playa pero no acceso directo",0
