2,Anna C,Jun 2022,"As the day progresses, the chairs become occupied. We stood on a fairly short line just before the pool opened in the AM and had our pick. The water was cool, clean and inviting. If you go later in the afternoon, it does get full. We only stayed at the pool for about an hour as the sun, even in the morning at 9 AM was strong. The poolside waitresses were polite and attentive. If you want to go later, by all means reserve a chair, then you have no worries.",1
2,Debbie M,Jun 2022,There were always empty chairs (first week in June - hot hot hot outside!). Definitely consider getting a cabana or ‚Äòunder an Umbrella‚Äô seating!!,1
2,Katie G,Jun 2022,Yes it does and people line up in the morning to get in on hot days. We rented the daybed one day and had no regrets. Really fun and you‚Äôre right next to the pool,1
2,Craig T,Jun 2022,"Yes, it does...so head out early to reserve your chairs. Of course, it depends on the occupancy of the hotel as well.",1
2,mherrmann33,Jun 2022,We had no problem. Just get their early as people tend to place towels on chairs they won‚Äôt use.,1
2,jockfun2,Jun 2022,no but paid ares better,0
2,Yannick359,Jun 2022,Get there early or reserve a chair / cabana. It gets crowded.,0
2,Darrell2999,Jun 2022,No. Chairs are available but pool is very small,0
2,Ford4sale,Jun 2022,Yes the only way we got chairs was we were the first ones at the pool at 9am.,0
2,Lily Nancy F,Jun 2022,It does start to get crowded around noon when most people are up. If you plan on spending all day at the pool a daybed would be worth it because you have it from open to close and you can come and go as you please. Personally I just drag my but of bed and bring a pillow down with me to snag a lounger continue snoozing by the pool. I leave by 1 pm usually because the sun just gets too hot for me by then unless you‚Äôre in the pool.,0
2,johnmerb380,Jun 2022,Yes,0
2,karenwQ4319KS,Jun 2022,Guess it depends on how many chairs you want together. There was 2 of us and we didn‚Äôt have a problem even tho it was crowded,0
2,Davor K,Jun 2022,You can usually find 2 chairs together more a little further from the pool in the shade it's more crowded in the afternoon,0
2,Kevin M,Jun 2022,"I always prefer a cabana. A little apart from the crowd, but you can invite your own guests. I like the shade, but you can worship the sun just outside the cabana, if that's what you like.",0
2,garyzaleski,Jun 2022,Monday or Tuesday is not as crowded,0
2,GeminiSky14,Jun 2022,"Hi There. There are seven pools. My husband and I never have a problem getting two chairs/umbrella and table. Of course, earlier is usually easier. People get up and leave all of the time. It will be steadily hot and beautiful. You may rent the cabana if you feel you want to be sure of having a comfortable spot set for the both of you. It‚Äôs different everyday and every hour, of course. You will love stopping at the gelato cafe and/or the Parisian bistro for fresh delicious coffee and a bite to eat by the pool (or inside). Enjoy your beautiful stay.",0
2,joanne M,Jun 2022,I personally like a cabana. More privacy and shade.,0
2,Travelpro Q,Jun 2022,We were there in March so it was still chilly. The pool wasn‚Äôt crowded but it was busy. I was going to rent a daybed for that trip but realized most people were wearing robes. I‚Äôm headed back in a few months and I will Reserve a Daybed to to make sure I have My space.,0
2,Sarah F,Jun 2022,"If you are there when the pool opens at 9am, we have never had a problem getting 4 chairs together.",0
2,Lisa R,Jun 2022,"Yes the pool gets crowded. People start lining up around 8:30 to get in and get there choice of chairs. There is turn over and you can get chairs together later in the day, but not a guarantee.",0
2,Cher B,Jun 2022,"I always make the assumption that I need a reservation everywhere I go because especially in summer, the pools are packed.",0
2,carport s,Jun 2022,the pool area is really big . i have bean in bellagio four imes and never have that problem the pool is really big so you never will have peoples close to you and far i remember is no deep so that is prefect for relax and drink,0
2,Kathleen B,Jun 2022,"Usually doesn‚Äôt look too crowded until you look closer, many of them have towels and are ‚Äúteserved for future use‚Äù by other hotel guests.",0
2,Dennis K,Jun 2022,"Not in my experience. There are many pools in the pool area. Just plan on getting there early when the pools open. If you wait too long, then it becomes crowded and the sun is very intense in the afternoon.",0
2,Roving18875658825,Jun 2022,don't know,0
2,California1214,Jun 2022,"It depends totally on the day of the week, weekends and Fridays are usually crowded these days, specially in the morning and late afternoon. Mondays to Thursdays are less crowded.",0
2,rnj589,Jun 2022,"Excellent advice from HannahS78 Essex, United Kingdom. See her posting below.",0
2,Denise P,Jun 2022,"You can go down early and place towels to hold your chairs. The weekends are busier, so go down extra early. Enjoy!",0
2,HannahS78,Jun 2022,Depends what time you are getting round the pool. If you get there for when the pool opens then you should easily be able to find beds together. It‚Äôs not long after it opens though that the beds fill up and you see people wandering around trying to find any that are free. Mid morning you wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance but towards the afternoon the people who will have likely have had enough and left will then leave more options.,0
2,timestevez,Jun 2022,Yes I would rent something if you want chairs together,0
2,melmolina530,Jun 2022,I had no issues finding a chair near the pool but then again we were there early in the week. The weekend rush might be different. Calling the hotel in advance helps with scheduling and preparation. Hope this helps,0
2,brookside24,Jun 2022,There are three public pools. And one totally private for vip members. It‚Äôs so hot right now nobody has a staying on the loungers for long. We never had an issue.,0
2,cam86w,Jun 2022,I had no difficulty securing poolside lounge. Probably depends on the month of stay. Perhdd as is heavier volume in summer.,0
2,Grayson C,Jun 2022,There is a lot of space at the pool to get chairs together. Doesn't get too crowded at all. So a day bed would jusg be a option for you.,0
2,nicehrladee,Jun 2022,"We had 6 in our party, and we were able to find 3 chairs together easily - we went down about 10am. We stayed until about 2pm and it never was super crowded.",0
2,ksdirtwork,Jun 2022,Not bad if you get out there early,0
2,saundra s,Jun 2022,"When I was there, there were always chairs available.",0
2,tusharrish,Jun 2022,Not too crowded. Alot of availability,0
2,springtimetexas2288,Jun 2022,We were there during the week and in the afternoon it was super crowded but late in the evening not so crowded,0
2,SandraChamplain,Jun 2022,"If you want VERY close to the pool (as in right next to it) rent chairs. There are TONS of chairs and many pools so as long as you go down to the pool in the morning, you'll have no problem. In the intense summer heat, many people don't stay there too long!",0
2,bhawthorne1957,Jun 2022,na,0

4,BENTLEY,May 2022,No as far as I know There is no happy hour at any restaurant in the Bellagio Hotel,0
4,angel92929292,May 2022,"I was there last week of February and they were closing the pool at 5pm. I did not hear of a happy hour. I know the pool is now open till 6pm , maybe now???",0

4,gzgz5151,May 2022,"No, 3-4 drinks will run you$100 or more . There is a bar away from the end of the private area (where you have to rent chairs), but might be mainly for severs. Take a lot of $$$. Our housekeeping and room service was atrocious.",0
4,Roger C,May 2022,I wish!!,0
4,Lorenzo M,May 2022,"Not a prestigious hotel like Bellagio or Ceasar‚Äôs. Each section (say casino floor, pool, Buffett, house keeping ) are considered different businesses with different overheads and budgets. If you‚Äôre not losing money playing a slot machine, you‚Äôre not gonna get a free Budweiser. Hope that helps.",0
4,maggiepat28,May 2022,Not that I‚Äôm aware of - there is not a bar - there is a cafe and there are beverage servers taking care of guests in the pool areas.,0
4,Michael B,May 2022,"Sorry, I did not visit the pool. Suggest calling Bellagio and asking.",0
4,margaryananahit,May 2022,Don't think so,0
4,richie19972019,May 2022,I never go to the pools or drink. I would suggest calling Bellagio directly because they can direct you to places that have exactly what you want. Ask for a host or concierge if the person on the phone doesn‚Äôt know. Let them know the dates you‚Äôre visiting. Maintenance might be scheduled and really disrupt your plan. After 9 trips in two years you learn to plan ahead and get information from the business directly.,0
4,kenneth,May 2022,"I would expect not, pool empties out pretty early, by 5 pm. When you think about it, why would casinos want guests to be enjoying a happy hour around a pool when they could be inside gambling and losing money?",0
4,Cliff H,May 2022,I do not recall any happy hour anywhere in this hotel.,0
4,dgpolansky,May 2022,"No, they do not.",0

7,Joanne P,May 2022,As per Kenneth‚Äôs andwer,0
7,Kenneth M,May 2022,"Its all over the board. You could end up with a view of Ceasars and its pool, or The Bellagio pool or anywhere in between. Pretty much the only way to get a view of the fountains is to have ""fountain view"" be part of the room title. That room type (premier) has been recently updated (last 2 years I think) and are really nice - thats what my sister usually gets when we meet in Vegas.",0

22,Janet R,Dec 2021,I think so but not positive. If you need one for sure call the front desk and ask before you go. They are very nice and helpful,0
23,Tankatron,Sep 2017,Always let them know in advance. They will usually supply most you request,1
23,MYO,Sep 2017,I don't know for sure however there service is so good I'm sure they would. I would email them directly with your specific request. Have fun! Michelle,1
23,Javier G,Sep 2017,Yes when your checking in let them know they should be able to do something. Also call so they can have in the computer reason for visit.,1

27,WHDSM,Aug 2017,"Game Limits depend on the game and table. Most card games I noticed were around 10K to 15K. Slot machine denominations were from 1 cent to 25 dollars. They have separate poker and high rollar rooms. Very nice, but go to the Wynn or MGM Grand if you need to bet higher.",0

29,pejenn,Aug 2017,Best to go to their website or call. Fees changes all the time. Highly recommend that you see the Cirque De Soleil O and the Mystere. They were really good. Best value place to eat is the Buffet at Aria hotel which is right next to Bellagio. Check out Momofuku at the Cosmopolitan Hotel too. Hope this helps.,1
29,medhashirali,Aug 2017,"Hi Stephanie...we stayed at the Bellagio for 2 nights in July. The charges for the King room with Fountain view were approx. USD 430 (since we paid in Indian rupees this is the close estimate that I can give). However, this covered only the room rent (2 adults) and was inclusive of 2 buffet breakfasts for the stay of 2 nights.",0
31,Linda E,Aug 2017,I have been staying at the Bellagio for 16 years and I don't remember ever being offered an upgrade. I have booked fountain view rooms sometimes and sometimes I booked just a regular room and when I check in put a $20 between my license and credit card and nicely ask if they have any complimentary upgrades. It's worked but it's nerve wracking.,1
31,Bexiboo09,Aug 2017,We were not offered an upgrade but we were there at NYE so I wasn't expecting one as the hotel was very busy. I actually felt as if we got a bit of a downgrade from our initially allocated room because we needed two beds not a king. We were initially on a high floor with a pool view and we ended up on the 4th floor with basically no view.,1
31,Andy L,Oct 2017,"we checked in yesterday. got offered an upgrade for $50 a night. didn't take it and glad we didn't too. This run of the house room is so nice. if you want nice views, spend the money you would have spent on the room upgrade on going on the attractions and up high buildings. stunning views everywhere here, why restrict it to your hotel room? :-)",0
32,gwynnie3000,Aug 2017,"Go with the Bellagio. It is tastefully elegant. Caesar's is a bit over the top, but the shops are worth visiting.",1
32,Bexiboo09,Aug 2017,All the big hotels are clean or they would never have guests - those cleaning crews deserve some major love for how quickly they have to turn rooms round. I'd go for the Bellagio. Caesars was nice to walk around but it was so huge and busy everywhere vs the Bellagio lobby and main casino bit being where most tourists were taking photos.,1
32,bigwideworld4,Aug 2017,Dont know your style but ceasers looked for us a bit run down - noisy and more lively - perfect for hen night. Bellagio is more calm and Classic how far You can be Classic in Vegas ;),1
32,Gooner1Nottingham,Aug 2017,As with others who have commented on this subject I am unable to comment on Ceasar's as I only stopped at the Ballagio. For a few extra dollars you can upgrade to a room with a view of the fountain's. However the windows are not very clean on the outside and there is NO Balcony to take pictures,1
32,Kaye N,Aug 2017,"I haven't been to Caesars but the Bellagio is beautiful and very clean, beautiful spacious rooms and bathrooms and great housekeeping!! Hope this helps?",1
32,Ryan,Aug 2017,"Loved our stay at the Bellagio, can't speak for Caesars for staying at but the place is great.",1
32,Edwin T,Aug 2017,Not stayed in ceasers only the bellagio but they both have an excellent location and are both 5 star so which ever you choose you should do ok,1
32,Planet100,Sep 2017,Bellagio we found much better. Caesars is a sprawling complex with a hard-to-navigate casino. Bellagio for all its size is easy to get around in and has a well laid out and comfortable casino. Base rooms at Caesars aren't the greatest but standard room at Bellagio is very good. Pool areas good at both. If staying at Bellagio upgrade to main tower fountain view.,0
33,Erika R,Aug 2017,No your resort fee covers the fitness center but you do pay for use of spa facility unless you are having a treatment.,1
33,KimTherese,Aug 2017,"Sorry I did not use it, so not sure.",0
34,Stephen S,Aug 2017,You don't have to pay for umbrellas but there isn't a one umbrella per 2 chairs scenario just so you know. They have many up but there are a lot of areas where there is no umbrella. If you want to pay the ridiculous price of $75.00 for a more plush sun lounger then you will get one. Get out early to beat all the multitudes of mainland Chinese that seem to have taken over Vegas.,0
34,chigurhanton,Aug 2017,I was there on business so I never got to experience the pool but I looked fun. And use sunscreen liberally.,0

35,Stephanie P,Jul 2017,"Hi Sharon, My husband & I just finished an 8 day vacation for my 30th between Sedona, Page, Utah, Nevada & Phoenix. We flew into Phoenix and drove straight to Sedona and stayed at a beautiful Air BNB. We booed a Pink Jeep Tour of the Red Rocks & Hiked Devil's Bridge. Day 3 we drove to Page, AZ. We had booked a tour for Rainbow Bridge Monument but it got cancelled so we drove to Utah to visit Zion National Park (Approx. 2 hours) which was super impressive. Day 4 we took a tour of lower Antelope Canyon & spent the rest of the day on Lake Powell. Drove into town to visit local wineries. Day 5 we woke up early and drove straight in to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon & from there drove straight to Vegas which was about 3 1/2 hours. We ate an amazing dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, seems cheesy but the food is SPECTACULAR! Day 2 in Vegas we laid pool side at the Bellagio & checked out some of the other hotels. The Venetian, which has a gondola experience - you feel like you are in Italy & Caesars Palace. At night we ate at Fiamma in the MGM grand which is where we bought tickets to see KA! Cirque du Soleil. Amazing Show! Day 3 in Vegas we stayed at the Paris Hotel across the street, also laid poolside & walked around Bally's which is attached to the hotel. Later that night we visited Old Las Vegas which was really cool & lively. There's so much to do in Vegas! To end the trip we spent our last night in Phoenix which is where we were flying out of. You can stay in Vegas & take day trips to other places but it might be a little exhausting & you won't really get to enjoy the best of each place. Hope this helps!",1
35,Mike,Jul 2017,"Hi Sharon, There are some spectacular 3 day tours out of Vegas. We've just completed the 3 Day Canyon Tour with Bindlestiff to Zion National Park, Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon, Antelope Canyon and the Grand Canyon. There's a camping or hotel/ cabin option. We combined this with 3 nights in Vegas, did some shopping, gambling and a show. I'd highly recommend it. Mike from London.",1

35,Jean R,Jul 2017,There are plenty of things to do in Vegas but go with very deep pockets and expect to be treated like cattle with the lines. My choice would be to take that cruise and enjoy being treated like they appreciate you being there. Enjoy the excursions or relax and do your own thing. We did a Bahamas Cruise about 5 years ago and loved every minute of it. I was the Bellagio for 5 nights in April. The best thing I did was the Conservatory. I do love the fountains. Other than that it is like herding cattle. I have better ways to spend my money.,1
35,Suzanne S,Jul 2017,"My own opinion, is that a week is to long to be in Vegas, we were there for three nights and managed to walk the whole strip in two days, plus saw two shows and had a fine dining meal. A cruise would be better for a week.",1
35,JasmineMarti,Jul 2017,"there is plenty to do in Las Vehas, it just depends on what you like to do. Vegas has a plethora of amazing shows. Hotels and casinos are worth visiting just to check them out for architecture, there is plenty of fine dining, and dining in all price ranges. you can also chill by the pool. So, yes, you can spend a week in Vegas.",1
35,TheHutchens,Jul 2017,"My husband loves to gamble, and I don't. I find plenty to do, but I am a HUGE pool person, so I will sit happily there most of the day, and then join him for shows in the evenings. I mean - if you've not ever been to Vegas before, there is plenty to see and do. However, I can't spend more than 4 days there - it's sensory overload past that point for me. What if you just went for 3 nights/4 days?",1
35,Sharon B,Jul 2017,Thanks for reply. It just seems long flight for just few days. I don't know how good casinos on cruises are. Cruise would be my choice but unfortunately it's his birthday ha x,0
36,Bj√∂rn H,Jul 2017,"I would assume that Queen ans King refers to the bed size and that Fountain view means windows on the front, facing the fountains. Lower floors (6-14) would give other perspectives on the fountains than higher floors (15-28), but another parameter is whether the room is on the sides or inte middle. To really know I would give the hotel a call.",1
36,Jill H,Jul 2017,Sorry but we opted to spend less on the room so no fountain view. I would think you would at least need to be up to to floor 16 or so for a good view though .,1
36,Stephen S,Aug 2017,I just came back from a 5 night stay in a King Fountain view room on the 15th floor. I wouldn't want too much of a higher or lower floor. If youre too high up you will be looking straight down from above the fountains and wont be able to really judge how high they shoot up. The 15th floor is perfect in my opinion.,0
36,HeZ777,Jul 2017,We were in room 11-010 and had an outstanding view of the fountains,0
36,Vicky L,Jul 2017,We were on floor 10 in a king fountain room and the views were amazing! They said at the desk floors 7 up had the best fountain views. Hope this helps,0

38,brad j,Jun 2017,"I have shopped various third party room providers, and I don't think I have ever seen a rate lower than what can be obtained directly from the hotel. That said, the key is this: go to the hotel web site and sign in to the hotel ""club"" whatever that might be. At Wynn, it is called the Wynn Insider. You sign up for the ""red card club."" Once you visit LV, make sure you get a ""slot card"" (join the club) at as many hotels as possible. Now that usually means the Mlife club for all MGM properties and Total Rewards for all of the Caesars properties. On a regular basis, regardless of the amount of your slot play, you will get email offers. Example: I will be in LV in Sept and staying at Aria where I have a great room rate plus $100 food credit. Also, if you are driving/renting a car, you want to consider getting an Mlife mastercard. This gives you free self parking at all MGM properties. IMPORTANT: remember that the cost of a room is seldom the advertised price: the cost is: room rate + about 13.% room tax + resort fee which ranges from $25 to $40 A DAY EVERY DAY. So when you see a great rate on a third party site, add the tax and the resort fee.",0
38,IvanCU,Jun 2017,I fail to see any advantage to booking with a third party. My best deals have always been by signing up on the hotel mailing list and then seeing what offers they send to me.,0
38,Ann H,Jun 2017,"Booking with a third party such as Trip Advisor or Expedia doesn't add a fee. However, everyone is charged by the hotel for sales tax and a resort fee for your stay, this is above the hotel rate you were given. At Bellagio, the resort fee is now over $40 per night.",0

I have not stayed at a MGM property where the response to any complaint wasn't rectified. I have overheard some very unreasonable complaints though.",0
52,mahendratiger,Jun 2017,It was a bad experience apart from the non availibility of coffee machine that are cheaters . They have charged me 260 US dollars for mini fridge where i had not used any one.

The fountain show is very good and rest is creating all the time Mahendra,0
53,AfricanMade,Jun 2017,We were in room 25037 with a view of the pool and the opposite number was 25036 and they had a fountain view but it was too high.

53,Joanne P,Jun 2017,"You can request a ""room with a view"" of the fountain. If this is your first visit there, I am confident that they will accommodate your request. They are many rooms and floors and wings as the hotel is built in a semi-circle. Hope this helps. Enjoy your vacation.",0

54,mahendratiger,Jun 2017,I also booked the fountain view but They had not given because bellagio was full and had to wait almost 3 hrs for the room Mahendra,0
55,Simon,Jun 2017,The tower is not part of the main hotel and any fountain view with be at a 45 degree angle from at least 300m away. We have a fountain view room on the 26th floor near centre and the the view of the Paris and the fountains was worth the extra $. Fountains run every 30 mins from 3pm to 8pm and every 15mins from 8pm to midnight so I don't know why anyone would say they are unpredictable. As a bonus your tv will also play the music they are dancing to :),1
55,Julie W,Jun 2017,"Re read the description, for a full fountain view you need to be in the Bellagio tower and not the Spa tower. We've just stayed in Tower Fountain view room and in the description is says it's 626 square feet (appx) and it was a corner room so you have a window out of the front then one to the side both from the bedroom then another side window from the bathroom. Fab rooms.",-1

57,Andy S,May 2017,"Hi, As you might expect, all the rooms are great at the Bellgio, we had a fountain view, overlooking the strip, great view. I would definitely get a fountain view room on one of the upper floors, if you end up at the rear of the hotel, overlooking the pool area, you'll miss out on this.",0
58,Michael2810,May 2017,Plenty of chairs and you can't reserve them as they'll remove your belongings after an hour.,2

61,Kathy M,May 2017,"The spa is wonderful. I believe if you get on the Bellagio web site: there is a spa tab. it'll tell you fees for it. Any treatment you get allows you to be in the spa and use the steam room, hot tubs all day. The staff is wonderful! There are lockers: you get a robe and slippers. You also can call their number. I had about 3-4 massages, and all were great.",-1
62,ZinKing,May 2017,Sure! It would be a great enhancement to your stay! You are going to LOVE it!,1
62,AvinAgg,May 2017,Definitely go down early if you want a premo spot... You'll always get a bed but might have to walk round a couple of times. Get a pool attendant to take you as they tend to remove towels from beds if they don't appear occupied. Ask as you enter the pool complex when they ask for your room key to confirm you're staying at hotel,1
62,S85AMG,May 2017,We have been at the pool 3 times during our stay and there were always deck chairs available. They have loads of... Depending how busy the hotel is and what time you will go down. Obviously I cannot guarantee that there will be some available and I don't really think you can book any. I would suggest you to go down a bit earlier let's say at before 9am and leave your towel on them before your breakfast... If you want though you can drop them an email.,1
62,Simon,Jun 2017,It your call. Maybe book it for one day as a treat but they are just the round rattan version and are poolside. They are not private and didn't look value for money at $250. All the cabanas are on the outer rim and are no in the sun. They have a Tv but again unless you have 6 splitting the bill and you plan to drink rather than sunbath don't waste the $650 and get done to the pool early instead,0
62,89cindyv,May 2017,"They don't have ""day"" beds like Caeser's unless you are renting the cabana. The lounge chairs are free unless you go into the ""adults only area"" and then the lounge chairs are nicer and have a thick cushion. There is a fee, not entirely sure but I think it is $25-$35 a person for the day. Personally I have never paid as I am quite happy around the other pools (there are at least 4). If you don't find an open one, there are plenty of staff to get you one. They are very accomodating & will move the lounge chair wherever you like as long as not blocking an entrance/exit.",0

63,ZinKing,May 2017,"Resort fees are all over Las Vegas (and that notion is spreading to other tourist destinations outside of 'Vegas). The $39 resort fee is unavoidable.

65,Kathy M,Apr 2017,"There is a restaurant that will pick you up, take you to their establishment and return you to your hotel. I was given to me as a nice romantic place but I never had time to go. And I cant remember the name. It sounded like a great idea!",0

My wife and I stayed in the Bellagio for a few nights and we only got charged for the bits out of the mini bar nothing else Mini bar was expensive about $7 for a water or red Bull but what mini bar isn't expensive If your worrying about spending a little bit more on things then Vegas ain't for you,1
71,mahendratiger,Jun 2017,They are great cheaters and charged me about 270 dollars for mini .bar where i had not used a single item .they also charged resort fee alter on while checking out/ better go away from bellagio. Only fountain show was great Mahendra,0

72,dkmauicondo,Apr 2017,Aloha We have stayed at Bellagio multiple times and never had a issue with billing and the front office staff have always been helpful and friendly. The in-house restaurants at the property are ok and can be a bit pricey but there are many options on site as well as next door across the street and there is a free shuttle to Aria as well so lots of options. For a first time trip it is an excellent choice. Enjoy your stay,0
74,mahendratiger,Jun 2017,They had charged me about 270 dollars for mini bar when i had not used any item just checked the type of brand it was kept. It is rediculous . They first take deposit while you check in then adjust the whole advance later on by over charging . You are just helpless and money gone . Be away Mahendra,0

Good Afternoon Mr. Billing, Thank you for contacting Guest Experience at Bellagio. The majority of our hotel rooms are non-smoking rooms for the convenience of our guests; however we do have smoking rooms in the Main Bellagio Tower. Please note that the entire Spa Tower is non-smoking. Smoking is permitted in all other public areas of the casino and in designated smoking rooms. Bars and any venues that are strictly 21 and over allow smoking. For safety and as a courtesy to our guests, smoking is not permitted in the following areas at Bellagio: o Any restaurants o Spa & Salon o Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art o All retail outlets o The Poker Room o The O Showroom o Hotel Lobby and Elevators",0

We had several drinks at Harvest in the Bellaggio lobby bar/restaurant and they were $14 a drink, but if you hit the happy hour which was 5 to 6 or 9 to 10 they were $7. If you want a deal, look for the happy hour specials.",1 vote
85,James C,Mar 2017,"Tipping in the US is customary. I tip based on the quality of service and not on the price of what I am getting. At a restaurant, for really good service from someone friendly and acts like he or she cares about what they are doing for you, I tip 20%. If the service is only so-so, I tip less, usually 10-15%. Most people in service jobs are not paid a living wage and depend on tips to make up the difference. You do not have to trip for poor service. That only insures that the person who gives poor service will continue to do so. When I get really poor service, I don't tip at all. That sends a message; you give poor service and I give no tip. I apply the same logic to other services such as taxi's, bellhops, etc. You get to decide what to tip and there is no set amount that is required. On bills that you pay by credit card, it better to leave the tip in cash, for tax reasons. There is no record :>).",1
85,Michael M,Mar 2017,I tip the bellboy who brings the luggage about $2-$3 per piece of luggage - around $10. Housekeeping.(maid) about $4 per day for 2 people in room. Concierge- maybe $5-$10 depending on time involved. At casino....$1.50-$2.00 per drink. Restaurants..20% for good service.,1

87,Jillian L,Feb 2017,No it won't be too small. They fill up very quickly so I would recommend getting down there first thing in the morning and saving yourself a spot. Other wise you might end up with one bed here.. two there.. and one without. Good luck!,1
88,Paul C,Feb 2017,I have stayed in both the main tower and the spa tower. From what I can remember there is very little difference in the rooms. I just prefer the main tower as I like the buzz that's happening there. The spa tower would get you away from the slightly smoky atmosphere in the casino however if that bothers you. Enjoy your trip whatever you decide !,1
88,Hennipenny,Feb 2017,"We haven't stay in the spa tower but it is a bit of a walk to the main casino. If you gamble and like to be in the middle of the action the main tower is probably a good bet. If you can get and would want a fountain view, the main tower is the place. If you want a little more quiet and nearer to the tram for the other strip hotels, that would probably be a good bet. After the mobs of people from our last visit, we will probably stay in the spa tower next time. Have fun and good luck.",0

When I checked in I asked for a room with a nice view and we were given a room in the west wing on the 27th floor with a view of the mountains. Checking Google .

113,peachy2me,Jan 2017,We did Christmas as well...not too late inconvenient but not an easy trek. We decided today that we really prefer being in a gaming hotel for stays longer than 3 days especially over the holidays. It's much more convenient because we ALWAYS rent cars but felt kind of bored in the hotel for 5 nights. Plus it was extremely cold this past holiday so walking was not pleasant.,0
113,CheeseMom52,Oct 2016,They have a free shuttle to Caesars and the Wynn,0
113,JDNYC,Oct 2016,It is quite bit a walk to the strip from the Hotel. I attempted one morning to go for a morning stroll and then quickly reconsidered when I got downstairs and noticed how far it seemed. Probably a 10 minute walk...,0

113,sandit2015,Oct 2016,We had a car and didn't walk or use the shuttle. It was over 100 degrees when we were there;so we were not inclined to utilize the shuttle or cross over to the mall while there.,0

113,lisabQ251QS,Oct 2016,"We used the shuttle, but the shuttle drop off & pick-up location is a little bit of a hike to the strip. Also, they stop shuttle service at midnight, but will continue to pick up if there are a lot of people waiting (if everyone can't fit on the shuttle) and there is no shelter while you wait for the next shuttle just benches to sit on. I would've hailed a taxi to get back to the hotel if it had been cold outside.",0
113,Alvaro P,Oct 2016,"It's a 12-15 minute walk to the north end of the strip, alternatively to avoid weather, you can cross the street from the hotel and get to Nordstrom (at the fashion show mall) cross the mall and exit on the strip. Hotel also offers a free shuttle to the strip, did not use it during my stay.",0
114,AllieInMD,Oct 2016,We are here right now. There is no strike and service is fantastic. It's the union asking people to boycott - not a strike - and the place is full.,0

114,Gary W,Oct 2016,"I was there a week ago and didn't have any problem whatsoever with service. It was excellent. They were friendly, helpful, and accommodating. I'm going to stay there again in December because I liked it so much and was able to get a room for $101 a night which blows away every other 5 star hotel in Vegas. This is not a casino. If you want a casino stay somewhere else. I like the peace and quiet (and no smoking anywhere) that the Trump offers.",0
114,pdamac,Oct 2016,Hello Not sure if December would be any better. I would actually consider the Bellagio for the same or similar price as we have found it much more accommodating and friendly. The rooms are nice but the atmosphere just seemed a bit off to us when we compare it to other stays at that level of price.,0
114,Avalma,Oct 2016,I really don't know. We had a wonderful stay when we were there at the end of September. I can only attest to that. My guess would be that you would have a wonderful stay no matter when you go.,0

When we were there in June 2016, we connected with this service by going out baggage door number 8 and there is a person in a booth that you can purchase the tickets from for this transportation. Or you can call them and they will tell you what to do.",0

However I would advise that we used the Trumps valet taxi service, basically $20 per trip which for us as a group of 6 was cheaper than a taxi. They came and picked us and dropped off somewhere else, great service..... On reflection I am sure if you contacted the Trump they will sort a driver for you.",0

One of my coworkers was there for only one night and got upgraded to a very nice suite at no extra charge. I saw his room and it was a corner room with a great view and a separate bedroom. Very nice. Never hurts to ask! Worst case nothing will be available. Or possibly they will offer a special upgrade price, or they might give you the upgrade at no extra charge. Definitely mention you've come a long way for the visit and are looking forward to spending your husband's birthday at the Trump. As mentioned a great attitude and smile always helps.",0
120,MarcoPolo41959,Aug 2016,It's definitely worth a try. The smile and the way a question is asked can make a world of difference! Hope your trip exceeds your wildest expectations!,0

120,traceygardiner,Aug 2016,"well its worth a try. it may be better to wait until you check in as they will know if any of the presidential suites are taken or not. when i got my upgrade I paid more but no where the price of what it usually is. I just said ive been travelling with my kids for three weeks and please say there is more than one bed! which was true. I didn't pay any tips until the next day we were so happy with our upgrade I gave the guy a tip. from my experience id imagine if they have a room available and you are ok to pay a bit more you will get your upgrade. Good luck, wish I were back there! :)",0
120,Linda W,Aug 2016,"I've legitimately said this a few times as I often travel on my or my husbands birthday and it's never worked for me. We went last September and it was our anniversary but didn't get an upgrade. I've had more success by asking for better room locations in advance e.g. High floor, quiet, good view. I was more than satisfied with the standard room here as they are really big with loads of storage. I've heard American guests often 'tip' at check in hoping to get an upgrade but I've never tried it as I think it's a bribe and therefore unethical. if your room is poor or something is broken you have a good chance of being moved to a better room though. I once got a great upgrade at the then Aladdin because they gave me a really smoky room and I have asthma, it was a battle but when I asked if they wanted to be sued for my hospital fees they gave us a high-rollers room on a special floor! That problem doesn't exist now and Trump is a no smoking hotel. It's a nice hotel and the staff are friendly- try it but don't be disappointed if it doesn't work.",0

126,familytimefun,Aug 2016,"when you check in they will show you the type of room you booked and the rooms that are available for an upgrade. for me the extra $50 upgrade and the $6 tax was well worth it. our room went from a standard room to a 1 bedroom high floor corner view of the strip. the room had. 2 baths, a jetted bathtub, etc.",1
126,MrWedge10,Aug 2016,No...yours will be great with all the comforts you'd want...unless you just want option to pay more for different city view.,1
126,Patti828,Aug 2016,I think we had the deluxe. We booked on priceline for a good price and that was automatically done for us. It was a nice size with the kitchenette and the bathroom was large.,1
126,cruisenerd_9,Aug 2016,I would say no. My room was huge. You can also ask to upgrade if youvdont like the room you get.,1
126,InadvertentGypsy,Aug 2016,"Deciding how much you will be in the room is probably the best gauge to decide if the larger room is better. I think our bathroom was bigger and when I say, bigger, it was huge! ha! There was even a TV IN the mirror. We had one of the apartment style suites and it was great because we could eat breakfast in the room and not have to worry about finding a place that made us all happy. If you're not going to be in the room much no need to spend the money. I honestly don't think there's a bad room on the property!",1

127,Derek Flint,Jul 2016,"As the others say, the higher the better. The strip view commands an additional $20/night usually. I normally do not pay the additional for strip view due to the limited time we spend in the room.",0
127,SteveOnT0ur,Jul 2016,"The higher the better and be sure to ask for a strip view, the hotel is bang on the strip looking down towards all the sites. Best view in Vegas.

128,whyersc,Jul 2016,"Across the street from the Trump is a very nice shipping mall and on one side of it are a few restaurants. The Mexican one is great for a tasty yet more casual meal. Two blocks down is Wynn and Encore. Sinatra Restaurant in Encore is very nice. I'd recommend there for a special dinner. Very supper club feel and suburb service. In the Stratosphere, a 10 minute cab ride away at most, is Top of the World restaurant. Spectacular views, rotating view, excellent food. Make reservations and ask by the windows.",1
128,Daniel C,Jul 2016,"There is a complimentary shuttle route which includes the Wynn, Encore and a few other hotels. There are incredible restaurants in all of them but I'd highly recommend booking ahead at any of the Wynn/Encore higher end. If you're looking to get away from the bustle of a hotel, The Shops at Crystals has bunch of high end stores and restaurants, Mastro's has a particularly neat multilevel setup.",1
128,Kidsncrisis,Jul 2016,"If you are staying at either of the Pueblo Bonito Resorts, Montecristo or Sunset Beach you have access to multiple excellent restaurants. LaFrieda's for a special occasion.

128,jazzSt_Louis,Jul 2016,"I've stayed there numerous times and if you walk through the mall, it will take you to the strip.....there is no need for taxi at all. Plenty of shops there, Saks, Nordstroms, Neimans......just enter the mall through Nordstroms, make a left in the mall and exit the mall at the strip. I love The Trump Int because it's clean, no casino, and the rooms are excellent. We've been upgraded to a suite many times. Have fun!!!",1
128,Andres A,Jul 2016,"Hi Try to do some homework on the restaurants as there are a lot of options, distance of this hotel from the strip is normal, not to far. There is a very nice mall just in front of the hotel. You must visit forum shop at caesar's palace and many more, happy bday!!!! In advance.",1
128,mishawaka_man,Oct 2016,"My wife and I were there two weeks ago. She absolutely loved the mall. She was there every day. They have the normal anchor stores, some very high-end stores, an apple store, and dozens of restaurant options. It is a huge and very nice mall. The entrance of Nordstrom is literally across the street from the Trump. There are some good options in the mall itself. Grimaldis is great for Pizza. El Segundo Sol was great for drinks, chips, salso, and guacamole on the patio on the strip. There is a nice looking Italian place but we didn't eat there. I saw someone say you would need a taxi. I had a rental car but didn't use it all during the week because I walked to everything I wanted on the strip. The Grand Canal Shops at the Palazzo/Venetian were 15 minutes by foot from the door of the Trump hotel. Don't miss them. They are fantastic and gorgeous. There are restaurants there by Wolfgang Puck, Mario Batali, Emeril LaGasse, and even Buddy the cake boss guy. Treasure Island is also 15 minutes, as is the Wynn. Trump has a shuttle to the Wynn and to the shops at Caesars. We didn't use it. You will absolutely love the Trump. Do yourself a favor and slip a tip to the check-in clerk and tell her that you are celebrating a birthday and are there any complimentary upgrades available. Don't be stingy. $50 for 5 nights in a suite was more than worth it for us. For those that think it is somehow unethical - they know nothing about Vegas and the way things work there. If you want something nice - you tip for it.",0

128,SteveOnT0ur,Jul 2016,Sorry forgot to add you will need a taxi to get to the restaurants its not really walkable. there are a few good lunch spots in the mall opposite but nothing for evenings out i don't think,0
128,SteveOnT0ur,Jul 2016,"The mall is directly outside the hotel and has amazing shops. Nordstrom is the one you walk through to get in, the US version of Selfridges I guess. We had some great meals but dinner at the Eiffel Tower and get a seat at the window so you can watch the bellagio fountains is rather special for a celebration. Also nobu was so good we went back twice. For a lunch spot we went back twice to guy fieri s burger joint on the strip the burgers are a work of art and the cocktails take your breath away! If you like bloody Mary's you have to go. The hotel bar shuts at 11pm so not very Vegas for info.",0

128,Maria M,Jul 2016,"This is very personal, but I recommend a nice lunch, brunch or dinner at Bouchon restaurant at Venetian. Either at their terrace, or inside. Great French restaurant in Las Vegas.",0
129,northern_dude,Jul 2016,"valet parking is free. Drive up and they take care, give you a ticket. A bit of a tip for the service. For pick up it may take 1-5 minutes to wait for car. They are pretty quick. As for rooms. they are all quiet. I always like the strip view. I would have to say that by calling won't do anything. But asking for specific rooms or upgrade when you are checking in always worked for me. They are always accommodating. Restaurants. The strip coming out the the entrance of the Wynn is about a 3-4 minute walk. The fashion mall is across the street from the entrance from the trump. Just walk across street and you enter a department store then you are in the mall. There is a decent food court and some great restaurants in the mall as well. Then you are on the strip at the front of the mall. The Trump also has a small van service that takes you to a couple resorts in lieu of you taking your car or taking a taxi. Can't remember where they exactly drop you off. oh yeah, sometimes you can here the train go by the Trump at around 6am You can faintly here it but not enough to make a difference. enjoy. I like the hotel.",1
129,Maria M,Jul 2016,"All rooms are quiet, the tips is a thing to do at all hotels, and it is not obligatory but at your discretion. Trump is the best choice on the Strip, and you can have great food at Bouchon restaurant, in Venetian complex and a kind of European experience in LV. Otherwise we felt the whole rest of hotels and malls were very noisy crowded and not our thing.",1
129,PJ F,Jul 2016,"Yes, the Valet parking is free and they have a free shuttle that will take you to the Wynn or Caesar's Palace, it comes every 15 minutes. I suggest the Wynn because it is classy and quieter than the rowdy crowds we ran into at Caesar's Palace. The food is expensive at the Trump so I would eat elsewhere. If you don't want to drive they have some great restaurants at the Wynn and the connecting Encore. The Mandalay Bay is a great place to hang out as they have so many restaurants and something happening on the main floor all the time, and it is connected to the Luxor by a hallway lined with shops. Luxor has a food court with cheap eats. But, be aware they are now charging for parking, both valet and self parking (which I don't suggest as it is a real trek to walk). All the ""M"" Life hotels are charging for parking now. The Cosmopolitan has free valet and a beautiful hotel/casino with some great restaurants. You can also walk out onto the Strip from the casino and the Bellagio Fountians are right there! The Trump is located right next to the railroad tracks and the trains come frequently all night and day and blast their horn 4 times as it goes past the hotel. It kept us up all night. We asked what a quiet room there would be and they suggested a corner room on the side of the hotel away from the train, but I was told by other guests that you hear the trains in those rooms too. Call the hotel, tell them your concerns and try to get a room high and away from the tracks...but we will not be staying at the Trump again for that reason, the 4 sleepless nights was a deal breaker for us. If you go to the Linc High Roller you should eat at Battista's Hole in the Wall right next door, ""Old Hollywood"" style with movie stars on the walls and great Italian food, you can picture the Rat Pack sitting and eating there! And you can easily walk from the Linc as it is right next door. I have posted on Trip Advisor many reviews of Las Vegas as we go often. So for more tips you can see my reviews. Hope you have fun on your trip!",1
129,thconstructivecritic,Jul 2016,The valet is free with in and out priv. But you have to tip valet each time. Try a room away from elevator for quiet room. Capital grill is across street in mall. Steaks etc but pricey. Trump has a shuttle to cesars palace. They have cheesecake factory and spago. Also a shuttle to winn hotel. Alegros at winn is good casual italian open late but a little pricey.,1
129,Diana R,Jul 2016,"Yes, there is a free valet parking available, also the pool is great and complementary services are included in the fee, like free bottles of water in your room. I'm not sure if you can make a room request before, you should try by mail or calling there. However all rooms are quiet because there is no casino at the hotel. Enjoy your stay! Great hotel",1
130,InadvertentGypsy,Aug 2016,There are several places near by to buy a few essentials. There is the CVS as well as the ABC store in the mall across the street. But you can catch Uber to the Costco and get a few extras. It doesn't cost much and might be better depending on the length of the stay. Have fun!,0

132,Cleopatra561,Jul 2016,"There is a resort fee (and there is for EVERY good hotel, Wynn, Bellagio, etc., in Las Vegas), but it is nominal - like $25 a night. There is NO $100 incidental charge.

132,Derek Flint,Jun 2016,"I don't know when the pool is open/closed. (call hotel) I don;t remember specifically what I paid for a resort fee but it was like $25 or $35 per day. I don't know what the 100d a day payment you're talking about. All resorts in Vegas charge a resort fee per day. To me it's just a hidden fee which should be included with the per night charge. I don't think you can stay (at any Vegas resort) without paying this charge so just smoke and mirror. To me it's like saying the room rate is $49/night, but there's a $150/day resort fee.",0

133,Warner,Jun 2016,"We stayed in a deluxe room, requested a high floor and got the 59th floor. 60th and above are penthouses. The deluxe room was 1 bedroom but had a living room area, king size bed, big closets, a kitchenette, and felt very large. I think it's around 500sq ft. We had an opportunity to upgrade to a corner suite (though I can't recall if it was a 1 bedroom), which we were told was about twice as big. We didn't go with it and were glad because the deluxe was more than we needed for our few days in town. I would say, if you're set on a corner suite, just request a high floor, instead of spending extra on the penthouse.",1
133,Lovemygolf7,Jun 2016,"It depends on how much glamor and classy enjoyment you can afford. To experience the penthouse is awesome but, the one bedroom corner suite is just as great. Trump International Hotels are elegant and luxurious anyway.",1

I requested and got a corner one bedroom, very high floor. 2 full bathrooms and the master bath was absolutely gigantic, but my husband had his own, so I had it all to myself :) This really is the BEST hotel in Las Vegas.

138,Stephanie L,May 2016,"Unfamiliar with military rates. Being a big military supporter, the rate quoted seems high. Call back and tell them that the website quotes one rate, and you want the military rate that's lower than the website. Trump believes that most things in life are negotiable - put this to the test. Enjoy your time. It's a lovely, quiet hotel with fantastic views. The people will treat you right, too.",0
138,carolinegH3397AR,May 2016,"Well not familiar with military rates, I booked on Hotels. com to use my accumulated credits however, I would suggest signing up for Trump loyalty card and book directly through Trump reservations and ask to get the best pricing not to mention there are perks for booking directly with this hotel such as early check in and upgrades etc. I'm sure they appreciate your service like I do and will make it right for you just speak up. Have fun in Vegas!",0
138,KonaJoe14,May 2016,"Hi there...that's a loaded question because I think it would be difficult for anyone to answer except for actual employees of The Trump hotel. I recently stayed there, and Im not military, but I found the rates to be highly competitive with other high-end resorts/hotels there, especially when considering the room my wife and I received for our dollars. Ive stayed at: The Venitian Cosmo Palms Place Mirage Luxor Mandalay Delano Rio Orleans Wynn Trump They all have good points and some not so good points... Ive never requested a military rate at any... What I CAN tell you about Trump is: Superior quality of experience, as good as, or better than, any of the others Ive stayed at Reasonably priced in comparison to the others for that experience Look, bottomline is: there will always be ""deals"" that you can find for any/all of these places that might make a ""military"" discount moot... Cheers! J.",0
138,Channell1979,May 2016,"Because nothing at that hotel ever seems to make any sense at all. I would advise not to believe Trumps advertised prices. Often you pay much more on everything including the $50 bucks for sliw wifi and 2-bottles of water. If you're looking for a true 5 star hotel, at a great value, then I highly recommend Palms Place.Good luck in Vegas.",0

I have never stayed in a ""room"" - only a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment at Trump, but I assure you that this is by far the BEST hotel in Las Vegas, and I've been going to Las Vegas at least twice a year for the past 45 years...........I love the No smoking and No casino. It is quiet, and that is a real plus to me. You are very close to Wynn if you really want to gamble, and you are directly across the street from the BEST shopping in the world - the Fashion Square Mall, with an entrance to Nordstrom right across (and even a crosswalk) the street. Truly, the BEST in Las Vegas!!! Do yourself the favor of booking at least a 1 bedroom 2 bath very high floor apartment. They are no more expensive than other properties, and they are 100 time more luxurious and QUIET!!!",0

142,Yes_No_Maybe,Mar 2016,I can't remember the exact cost but at the desk they told me it covered things like the shuttle bus to the strip.

144,Helen P,Mar 2016,Last time was approx. $ 34 a Day for the resort fee. It is steep and LV is getting very expensive every year. All we did was sleep and enjoy the accomodation with a breathtaking few. Enjoy your stay and the shopping across from the hotel.,1
144,Richard M,Mar 2016,"Agree with Vitor B. It was something around 30.- The best with the place was though, NO CASINO in the hotel but bad and expensive breakfast because they don't have a buffe. For the rest, great.",0
144,William S,Mar 2016,"I think from memory that figure is correct, but maybe you think it encompasses what you imagine a 'resort' to be. The Trump has an ok gym included in the resort fee, but other services like massage therapy you pay extra. You should email the hotel and ask exactly what you get for the resort fee. Where I stayed in San Diego at the Sheraton, it had multiple outdoor pools and a ""resort feel' about the hotel. The Sheraton was definitely a resort but I would not put the Trump in that category.",0

153,Ireland547,Nov 2015,Agree with DeAunderi,0
153,DeAunderia,Nov 2015,There are 2 banks of elevators that control how how you go. The staff check your hotel key card to determine which one you can go to. Perhaps there is a new numbering system after 35. The elevator we had went from floors 52-64. Hope this helps clarify things for you.,0

154,Michael A,Nov 2015,"It's probably at most a 5 minute walk to the very north-end of the strip when Wynn and Encore are. Alternatively, you can walk through the mall which is directly across the street and in 10 minutes end-up across from Treasure Island. The center of the strip is further down, probably 20-30 minute walk to Caesars depending on your pace. As I said in my review, we like to walk and you're going to walk along the strip anyways so we didn't mind at all. Also, they have a shuttle but we didn't really use it. For us, being at the hotel it was a nice break from the strip action without actually feeling disconnected from the strip since it's just off of it. If you want to take an elevator down and be in the heart of the action maybe consider somewhere in the middle of the strip.",1
154,hilarionmartinez,Nov 2015,"I stayed here because I was offered a great deal for four nights; it was worth it. The one bedroom/two bath suite I was provided was superb and the hotel is new and beautiful. The inconvenience of not being on the strip was worth the price. The hotel is across the street from a very nice and new mall which when you walk through it in air conditioning and window shopping, you will end up on the strip where the Pirates show used to me. It also will end at the tip of the mall where you will find the 50% off tickets booth to book your shows. I found this to be very convenient in that I would walk through the mall each morning, end up at the 50% off ticket booth,and then proceed to the Strip. I also often would eat breakfast in the mall as it was cheaper and better than in the hotel. If you get a good deal on the Trump, take it! Now, if you have an option of hotels, I would recommend anything new the Paris or New York hotels. That is the main part of the strip where you will find the shops, nice hotels, shows, and tons of overweight people walking around. Also with the Trump, I often returned with a cab which was less than $10 from almost anywhere on the Strip. Sometimes, I would wait for the Trump shuttle and take that if it was convenient.",1
154,Jdcarcollector,Nov 2015,"It's not directly on the strip... But when I was there, there were no sidewalks and its situated on a busy street. So while they provided a shuttle to the strip (10 min walk) the question of getting back comes into play.

154,Tracey1232013,Nov 2015,"hi, It's about a 10 minute walk from the Strip - you can either walk the road way or via one of the shopping malls. There's also a free shuttle bus every 15 minutes that will take you to either the Wynn or Caesars Palace. If you're going when it's really hot then you may want to stay somewhere on the Strip as it can be too hot to walk far outside - but if the weather will be cooler you should be fine. If you have the money to spend the extra - stay on the Strip - you'll do enough walking whilst in Vegas without needing the extra to and from the hotel. But if you want to keep costs down - then this is probably one of the nearest hotels to the Strip that's not on it (it that makes sense).",0

Non-brainer. I switched and it is great. I just returned from a month in Portugal, Spain, Prague, Austria, and Budapest and it worked well everywhere. I have also used it when on a cruise and the free data turns on as you enter each port. I think they also have a special cruise plan which I did not get but which is cheaper than the cruise price.

If you feel like you need more, they also have private rooms/cabanas next to the pool for rent as well as larger covered lounge chairs for rent. Plenty of plants and palms aside the pool.",3
164,Joya D,Aug 2015,"I would agree with the previous response, except that I wouldn't describe plants as being plentiful. There are some, mostly bordering the pool area, but there could be more. The landscaping is tastefully done. I think the amount of foliage has been sacrificed to have more seating. It is a very pleasant pool area. Not crowded at all. The attendants will gladly position the umbrellas as requested.",2
164,ed s,Aug 2015,"Sorry that I cannot answer those questions. I have seen the pool and it is very lovely and inviting, but i have not been to the pool to know about chairs. The chairs are at the pool and already set up so my belief is that these are complimentary. I never even thought that there was a fee.",1

165,Christy_ve,Aug 2015,Don't worry you got a great hotel. The staff is awesome so much so that when we waited in line they came and gave us bottles of water. If that doesn't say service I don't know what does. They bent over backwards for us. Priceline screwed up our reservation and Trump staff fixed it. The rooms are fantastic great for a girls weekend. As far as being off the strip no worries. There are two shuttles. They go every 20 minutes but you are just on the other side of fashion show mall then on the strip. Literally a three minute walk. Enjoy your stay you will have a great time.,0
165,Matt L,Aug 2015,One more thing... You can walk right across the street and cut through Fashion Show Mall if you want to get to the strip with some air conditioning. My wife used this as an excuse to do some extra shopping.,0
165,Matt L,Aug 2015,"This hotel is awesome. It's on the north side of the strip, but isn't that far. It's one block off the strip near the Wynn. There are 2 free shuttle services... The first one takes you to the Wynn and back (one block down and back) and the second takes you to Casear's Palace (hotel located in the middle of the strip) and back. The hotel, rooms, pool, etc. at Trump are awesome. I was also nervous my first time staying there and have gone back since after having such a good experience.",0
165,RDRCP3,Aug 2015,"Trump is at the far end of the stripe near the Fashion Mall. If you walk right across the street from the hotel to the mall you are on the walk way and very close to many hotels and casinos. As for the staff, my experience was the polar opposite of the other comments you mentioned. I found the staff to be outstanding. Additionally the hotel and rooms are beautiful.",0
165,Jim B,Aug 2015,Yes the shuttle will take you to the strip I believe it runs every 20 minutes you do not need to worry about the staff as they are incredibly polite and courteous. Not sure if you're renting a car because all the hotels offer free valet is well in the cab ride to the strip won't cost too much money either so there's lots of options to get to the strip. As far as the train goes we would hear once in a while it but it was nothing it did not bother us at all and being the most comfortable beds and pillows we have ever slept on in the hotel you will sleep so well the train is not a factor at all.,0
165,MyLifeAsaPirate,Aug 2015,"First off, for my visit the staff was anything other than ""inattentive;"" they were super polite and helpful. I did not meet a single employee who made me feel like they were just there for a paycheck and didn't actually want to help me. The shuttle runs every 15-20 minutes, and like the previous poster said, it goes to the Wynn and to Caesars. However, it is Vegas - unless you buy a bus pass every day you are going to do a lot of walking. That's one of my favorite parts actually. You get to walk around and take your time to enjoy the architecture of everything. Vegas is not just gambling and hookers... the entire strip, minus the homeless people every 20 feet, is a work of art. I enjoy walking through the Miracle Mile and the shops at the Venetian and just admire how cool it is. If you have a vehicle (bus, taxi, shuttle, etc.) take you every where, you don't get to appreciate all of that. One good thing about the Trump is that you are literally right across the street from the Fashion Mall, and one of it's entrances. You can cross the street, and walk right in. You can check out all of the stores and grab a bite to eat at one of the many restaurants, and then exit out the other side onto the main strip. It is a healthy walk, yes, but as I said previously - you cannot avoid LOTS of walking in Vegas unless you are always in a bus or taxi (and wasting butt loads of money at that.) The train was a bother for me during my stay. It was EXTREMELY loud, and I was on the 48th floor. It would make our windows vibrate. However, it only lasts for 2-3 minutes and then you go right back to sleep. It sucked, but was not a complete deal breaker for me ever visiting again. Enjoy the walks, you'll regret not taking all of the sights in. Take advantage of the shuttle by all means, as it is free, but try not to avoid walking altogether. If nothing else, at least walking a good 1-2 miles a day on the strip is good for your health and makes for some awesome photos.",0
165,nikkib710,Aug 2015,"Also, the train didn't bother us. We stayed sat-Monday and didn't hear it once. We go out daily, and slept at night. Not sure if that mattered, or I sleep heavier than others, or it was that our room was on the 54th floor, but I had no complaints.",0
165,nikkib710,Aug 2015,"Yes the shuttles take you to the strip. One for Caesars palace, one for Wynn (Caesars is the more center popular part). I did not use their shuttles but I think they said they run every 20 minutes if I remember correctly. I don't know how late they run. The hotel itself is fabulous, you won't be disappointed with the room.",0

On the return trip to the airport the hotel has very nice transportation that you give the driver what you feel is reasonable.(We rode in a Cadillac Escalade, nice) but it is not a regularly scheduled means of transportation.

It's very close. Cost is approx $8 per person and they are open 24 hours. Their phone # is 1 702-739-7990 if you want to book in advance.,1
176,Andrew H,Jun 2015,"Hi Monica, there is a shuttle that runs between The Trump and Caesars Palace but it's not 24/7 however the hotel is relatively close so we walked either through the shopping mall which is directly opposite or around it. It's probably a 10min walk to the Venetian and probably 25mins to Caesars, mainly because you're always stopping and going ""wow look at that!"". We walked the new strip all the time and even down to Circus Circus. You will need a cab or bus to get to downtown which is Fremont St. and the Stratosphere as it's too far to walk, we were shocked how long it was - I think the entire strip is about 4.5miles long!!! Hope that's helped and any other questions feel free to ask! Oh, you MUST do the Buffet at Caesars Palace - Anazing! We're talking fresh scallops, wood fired pizzas, sliders, oysters, sushi plus desserts - well worth the money and a tip for the buffets rock up about half an hour before breakfast finishes and you'll get the breakfast dishes swapped over for the lunch time service and you only pay for the breakfast! So effectively you get brunch :-) Have a fab time, we loved it :-)",1
178,Sudhir S,May 2015,"There is no self parking but there is a valet parking. They didn't charge me anything extra for it and is included in the $30 resort fee but I did tip when I got car back.

184,Rothvin B,Apr 2015,"There is no provision for self-parking at this property. All autos use valet parking service. If one has to come and go often, it would be to one's advantage to tip an amount for the whole time one were there. I think today one needs about $5 tip each time. The shopping is directly across the street and the Strip nearby. I did not use the room service. I would expect it to be possible to order but am not sure. The beds are very comfortable to me and I understand that all furnishings are replaced every five years in the condo rental program so everything is very new.",0

Way worth it so we didn't have to walk and carry groceries. The mall is across, but we found it to be pricey for what you get. Reminded me of when you go to NFL event or Airport. They charge you double for same thing you can get anywhere else. We went to Nathan's and spent $26 for 2 meals of Hot dogs, shared chili cheese fries and 2 sodas. And it was pretty awful. We decided there and then, no more mall. Take the free shuttle, the bus or cab and go to other hotels with casinos. Some of the restaurants in them and stand-alone's on the strip have happy hours with food and drink specials. Go have some real food for the same, or close to the same, $ as the mall. Much better and more enjoyable. We loved the steakhouse in the Monte Carlo casino. Great happy hour, food and service.

209,MandyPW90,May 2022,If you stay at park MGM you can‚Äôt use the MGM pool unless you reserve lounge chairs or cabanas. It is this way for most of the pools in Vegas. I reserved two lounge chairs at the MGM pool and it was very worth it! I think you also get a small discount on food and drinks when ordered through the server in your reserved section which is something I mistakenly did not take advantage of!,0
209,gormel2,May 2022,You don‚Äôt need to reserve seating unless you want a daybed or cabana and as far as using other MGM pools I thought you were able to but I asked at Luxor if I could go just check out Mandalay Bay‚Äôs pool and they told me no.,0
209,stephj682022,May 2022,Hi! You do not need to reserve seating unless you would like a cabana which has a cost. There are many lawn chairs available as they have 3 pools in one area. You are able to use the MGM grand pools along with the Aria pools. You will love staying at the Park MGM,0
209,Joseph McNeill,May 2022,I know if you have a players card and a guest at ParkMGM you can utilize any of the MGM resorts property. Hope this helps.,0

214,GrandTour38185146842,Jan 2022,My stay at PARK MGM was November 2021 I checked in at the hotel desk. I did not use MLIFE app or any other app. I got actual room keys and my stay was great. The housekeeping staff came every other day. The price to the airport was like $16 at the time I was there. I hope you enjoy your stay at Park MGM.,3
214,M3116PJcynthiam,Jan 2022,Inform housekeeping you would like service daily. Cost of taxi to airport is around $25 US dollars. Maybe a little higher now due to gas price increases.,2
214,Carol S,Jan 2022,I'm pretty sure you'll have to call M Life and find out how you can get your credits for staying at that hotel since you've already booked. It's around $20 to the airport but you might want to ask if they have a hotel shuttle. I drove in so I didn't ask,1
214,ajamuazibo .,Jan 2022,I called for house keeping because I was not ready for the morning service. I was told house keeping does come daily and they have a morning and an evening shift. They should definitely clean the room daily but if you are unsure just call from the room phone and they will accommodate.,1
214,KM-COMO,Jan 2022,Agree with the others. I definitely would get a physical key as my experience with the digital was mixed‚Äîparticularly in the elevator. Taxis were readily availability and they have standard fares from the airport to the hotels. I think it was around $25.,1
214,Todd C,Jan 2022,"Sounds like you got your questions answered. I did want to add that I used the app to check in but went to front desk to get a physical key as well. The app usually works on your door but just in case your battery died and needs a charge or to many cocktails, it‚Äôs good to have a backup. Hope that helps",1
214,Deanna A,Jan 2022,Not sure about MLife but they are usually super helpful - when I was there in September they would clean or not on request. We drove and haven't taken a taxi from the airport in years but thinking it would be about $30.,1
214,Kim O,Jan 2022,"Our stay was Dec. 21st - 24th. We went to Park MGM by Uber/Lyft ~$30 for 3 people. I checked in at the MLife VIP area, but checked out at the Front Desk, because I was accidentally charged for an item in the minibar, because someone had accidentally bumped into the tray and knocked an item over. We had room service daily.",1
214,Roberts B,Jan 2022,"I don‚Äôt know about your key/phone question since I booked direct with the hotel online. The room cleaning was every 3rd night unless requested more often. We had a rental car this time, so I‚Äôm not sure about the taxi charge. From prior visits, I seem to recall $30 to $40 for hotels on that part of the Strip. Hope that helps a little. Don‚Äôt lose too much money!",1
214,Stephanie V,Jan 2022,If you can use the app I recommend it. The key cards demagnetize easily. Taxis are reasonable in the area.,1
214,Jaycee D,Jan 2022,If you can view your reservation on MLife YES you can‚Ä¶ Taxi no idea as I drive all the time heading to Vegas. Room cleaning is daily unless you don‚Äôt want it‚Ä¶,1
214,Francisco R,Jan 2022,Your Mlife app will let you check in and out of your room at any Mlife hotel. It also helps you look for restaurants at hotels at Mlife.,1
214,maryll,Jan 2022,"I have no idea if you can do that coz I usually book mine with the Mlife app. Regarding house keeping if you prefer it everyday they will do it. I use uber not taxi because it‚Äôs way cheaper, also the taxi line is too long especially on weekends.",1
214,BrandiePov,Jan 2022,"We checked in the day before using the app, our room was ready by the time landed and got to the hotel at 11:00 am. We did got to the front desk later to make sure my name was on the reservation so I could charge back to our room. We received room service everyday. Never had to ask. We always get a limo so I cannot help you with taxi or uber cost.",1
214,Dougie732,Jan 2022,28 for the taxi. I don't know about checking as we also have the Mlife card and checking in on line did not work as the digital key would not work. We had to request housekeeping.,1
214,Tom L,Jan 2022,"I used my app to check in, although there was no one in line at the time we got there. You can request housekeeping every day if you'd like, as far as I'm aware. I was there for 4 nights with clean towels & sheets every day. Hope this helps?",1
214,J R,Jan 2022,"I was there in September 2021. When we, it was about $15.00 for an Uber from the airport. The room was cleaned upon request. We checked in using the mlife app. We also used a digital key through the app. I would suggest you get a standard key as well. I found that if you didn't have the app open before you entered the elevator, it was hard to bring the app up with the poor cell coverage in the elevator. We talked to another guest who had the same trouble with the digital key. He got stuck in the elevator for about 15 minutes until someone else opened the door. You need the key to be able to push the button when you're in the elevator.",1
214,Marcela M,Jan 2022,"I also had issues using the digital key on my phone so I recommend getting a physical key, which you can also do at one of the kiosks. A cab from the hotel to the airport at 11 am on a Sunday costs us $25, after my flight was cancelled and had to head back to the hotel I chose Lyft which was only $18.",1
214,Liz M,Jan 2022,House keeping at park mgm comes daily but your staying at virgin I believe that is a different branch Enjoy your trip,1
214,X2481IJjackp,Jan 2022,"I‚Äôm not sure about using the app. We booked through MGM and the check-in process was simple‚Ä¶no reason to go through the registration desk as long as you are comfortable with a digital key. The elevators require you to use the digital or a physical key. I would also suggest looking at car services rather than a taxi right now. This time of the year, I would think that the services would be very reasonable and a much more elegant ride to the hotel. One of the very discerning things that we did not like about the hotel was that there are absolutely no drawers to put anything into. Yes, you read that correctly. There is a very weird kind of closet that comes out about 8 inches from the wall and you might be able to hang 3 to 4 items in it. We ended up laying out all of our clothes on a very long couch that was in our room. The service was great and everybody was very nice. The location is very good and the hotel is very clean. The food court at the front of the hotel is very interesting and I would recommend it. It is called Eataly and it offers a variety of fresh made plates from about 25 to 30 different stations. You can get sandwiches, pizza, chicken, drinks, etc. I‚Äôm not a food court person but I would highly recommend this one.",1
214,G B,Jan 2022,"Agree with the other responses. Also advise to get physical keys and not use the online checkin app. sometimes I try to use the app and it says I can‚Äôt. Other times the digital key doesn‚Äôt work correctly in the elevator. Take the time to check in, get physical keys, understand the layout of the property and ask any questions u may have about promotions, etc. If you‚Äôre there for 6 days, even if it takes 30 minutes in line it will be worth it to avoid the hassles free online app and the digital key.",1
214,Abby S,Jan 2022,"Yes, you will be able to check in with your MLife Rewards app. I had booked my trip through Expedia, and I was still able to do this. You can start filling out your info on the short cab ride (unless you want to look at the sights!), and then use the qr code you are given at the kiosk in the lobby. You will have the option of digital keys or plastic keys. We chose the plastic keys which worked just fine. Enjoy your trip! Vegas is a lot of fun!",1
214,dakotaramey6,Jan 2022,"Hello! You can check in using the MGMResort app and they will send you a room key digitally, you can share the with whoever from there. The taxi will run you about 25 bucks. House keeping is daily unless you opt out of house keeping! Have fun!",1
214,rhawkins2021,Jan 2022,"I am not sure about the check in from the app, but check in is painless at the MGM and can also be done quickly at the express check in kiosk. I prefer Uber over a taxi. They are just usually much cleaner and should not cost more than $30.00 from the airport. Housekeeping is done daily, and by the way, they do a excellent job and I always leave them a tip! I think you will enjoy the hotel, and if you want a nostalgic drink, you need to visit the Library Lounge in the hotel. Dark and cozy like old Vegas used to be.

214,Leigh D,Jan 2022,"Hello. If your reservation shows on your app, you should be able to check in on the app. When I was there in September, housekeeping was by request only, but you can request every day if you like.

214,kareemathomas07,Jan 2022,You can check in using the Mlife app which is highly recommended especially since it tends to get very busy. Housekeeping is done daily. I do not know how much a taxi would cost because I used Uber hopefully this helps.,1

The additional pet fee also includes deep-cleaning charges since the room is taken out of service for an additional time for the specific issue of possible allergens to future guests. They do have the special Stay-Well rooms at an additional price with added amenities which are not pet-friendly, but that does not ensure you'll experience the same level of hypoallergenic cleanliness in public areas where dogs can travel to and from the parking structure, room, and pet relief/play area.

There is a CVS Drug very, very close (just North, same side of street. Just by eyeballing the menu at the entrance, the UPSCALE breakfast place is soooo expensive; the sort of place you'd go for a power meeting. Eataly is a sort of indoors farmer's market where you can buy bread, cheese, wine, crackers, olives, sandwiches. It all looks good, but overpriced. They were in the midst of a remodel in March 2018 when I wasn't an overnight guest (watching games on TV.) By now, the complete remodel has been in place for 18+ months. I would say that it compares in quality to Paris or Mandalay Bay, but lacking the shiny object wow factor. Room rates at Park MGM would be cheaper than Paris or Mandalay Bay. Park MGM is the 3rd cheapest of the MGM properties. The cheapest is Excalibur. 2nd cheapest is Luxor.",1

According to the front desk staff if you even knock something over inside of the refrigerator you will be charged for the item.

296,schlomom,Feb 2022,"We were charged for a bottle we did not use, after opening the fridge. We found out only after check-out. So the answer is clear. Maybe possible by special request, as suggested, but I doubt it, like the other responders.",0
296,Patricia A,Feb 2022,"I don't think so, they want you to spend your money on their stuff. I would call the hotel and ask.",0
296,Marty S,Feb 2022,Probably not. We had that problem where we wanted to save food in the fridge overnight from room service and there's only room for a small item. That's the one thing I wish they had larger fridges esp for water. Ask them if they can deliver a small fridge.,0
296,jerrie C,Feb 2022,No I don't think the Venetian would emptu the mini fridge for your drinks. We travel with strong plastic garbage bags and use them as a cooler in the sink. When done wr throw them out.,0
296,outtahere456,Feb 2022,No‚Ä¶but if you have a medicine that needs to be refrigerated and/or are breastfeeding you can request one at no charge‚Ä¶.,0
296,Greta G,Feb 2022,I doubt it too. It's not that kind of hotel -- the staff is not very friendly or amenable (except for cleaning staff who are wonderful). And yes - they love those sensors as a way of charging extra.,0
296,LisaLozza,Feb 2022,"I highly doubt it. They have sensors in there, so that would mess everything up. They don't even have coffee makers in the rooms, so you have to order coffee!",0
296,fand,Feb 2022,"I don't think so. As a matter of fact, I wanna say there was something in the room that said you can't store your own stuff in there even with it full of the mini fridge items available for purchase or they'll fine you.",0
296,dgriffsh,Feb 2022,"We asked because we had kids. The lady told us that there was a $150 charge because the minibar has sensors that need to be deactivated. We blocked it off but it was irritating. However, they do offer free parking that did offset some of the inconvenience.",0

308,Tony O,Dec 2021,To be honest there are so many other people checking in I don't think you will get any personal or preferential treatment. You are literally only a number here. No discounts or upgrades. They just want all the money they can get their hands on like Vegas I'm general. Bring plenty of dollars. You'll need them. Do not touch anything in the fridge or on top. Even if you touch it you will be charged !!!,0

308,Barbara C,Dec 2021,"I do not think they will accommodate. We arrived at 1:00 pm and waited on line until 4:00pm our rooms were not ready so we took our luggage to get something to eat by the time we waited another hour to eat the rooms were ready, there will be no one to ask or help. You will wait on a ridiculously long line (if it‚Äôs still the same)to ask a question or check in. We asked for a refund of the ‚Äúresort‚Äù fee but they said NO.

324,Brittany S,Aug 2021,"I believe they do charge for a lost key. However, I do not think its much. Also, you do need to scan your room key to use the elevators but this is meant for your protection.

324,Carl B,Aug 2021,All guests and visitors have to have a key to get to the elevators.,0
324,bconthecoast,Aug 2021,I lost a key and they just replaced it for free. Its not an actual key just a scan card. You have to show your id to security guard at elevator entrances to get through to room elevators. For guests I suppose you need to go down to floor and meet them.,0
324,Rudy C,Aug 2021,You are allowed to bring guests to the room. I brought about eight people our room to celebrate my wife's birthday.,0

324,Toni C,Aug 2021,"I am not sure about a charge for lost keys. You do have to scan your key to permit you to go to the elevators, but not everyone has to do that. If you are with someone with a key that is fine. There were days I left my key in the room because my roommate had his or other friends had their keys to their different rooms on different floors.

324,Bradford A,Aug 2021,"You do have to scan a room key to access the elevators - I assume for security reasons. If you have a guest that is not staying at the resort and wants to get to your room, you would need to come down and meet them at the security (scanning) checkpoint. I do not know if the resort charges for lost keys. I do know they will potentially charge you if you move or pickup items inside the mini-fridge. It triggers a device that will charge the item to your room. Over all however , this is a very nice resort with high quality features.",0
324,Stick55,Aug 2021,"No they don‚Äôt charge for lost room keys, as far as guests going to your room I think as long as you are together and someone has the key they are fine. My party we all had our own rooms so when we headed towards the elevators they have security near entrance and you had to scan in to be allowed to proceed to elevators. I think the workaround is to simply get additional guest keys from front desk. But you definitely will need to Have a key on person at least that‚Äôs how it was in April when we went.",0
324,Chicadin,Aug 2021,I don‚Äôt think you pay for lost room keys but most resorts that require a room key for the elevator only allow you to go to your floor. Makes sense security wise because people should only go to their floor. Meet your friends at the elevator and take them up. It is a hassle if the ice machine doesn‚Äôt work on your floor though.,0
324,Tina M,Aug 2021,I do not know if they charge for a lost key. You would have to have the key to bring up a guest. A guest may not enter without a key.,0

Guests are not permitted to have their masks down while walking the resort or casino floor. In the casino, all players and spectators of table and card games are required to refrain from smoking or vaping.",0

350,MLMRocksTravel,Feb 2021,"Uber is a long walk at the airport and at the hotel. It will cost about $30 each way. If you contact the Venetian concierge, they can get you set up with a limo company (they do it all....includes all hidden fees and the mandatory 20% grat). You will be greeted at baggage claim, taken directly to the hotel...helped with luggage, picked up at the front doors and delivered right back to check in. All with a professional driver and beautiful car, includes beverages and snacks. I tried booked a couple of transportation companies on my own....and it was a hassle either wanting debit cards and the pin number (that is a BIG no way) or quoting me a price then adding a ton of excessive fees on the final confirm. Having the Venetian book it was so simple and the price was great! Easy, classy and memorable. Uber is the way to get around town after check in!",8

A fridge will cost you $40 a day. The mini bar in room is scale based so if you take something off or out of the fridge that is in there for an extended prior of time it will auto charge to your room. For a fridge I used one of the sinks (there are 2) and placed ice and drinks in it and covered it with a towel and this worked just fine for us.,3
358,richardswinifred,Nov 2020,I had a luxury suite. Maid service came and replaced towels cleaned while I was out. I‚Äôm unsure if you can have a Empty refrigerator in your own room. Mine was fully stocked. But you can always request and see what happens.,2
358,Simone Y,Nov 2020,They will clean your room every day if you want. They will even provide extra toilettes and towels when you aske housekeeping. The refrigerator in the suite is only for their own drinks and snacks. It is very sensitive to the touch and they will know if you removed anything from the top shelf on the armoire or the actual refrigerator.,2
358,Augusto,Nov 2020,Yes they clean the rooms regularly. There is a small spot where you can put your water in the fridge in the standard suites. Just a couple of small or medium bottles. You can have a fridge for just your food and drinks in the larger suites.,2
358,ashesw25,Nov 2020,"My husband and I got a luxury suite for an extra $120 a night and we had the standard stocked fridge as well as an extra empty fridge.

Bed was average, we've had better but it was not a problem. We had the strip/fountain view on a high floor. Definitely could hear the club down below until the early hours of the morning so if you want quiet you will want the opposite side of the hotel but you give up the view.

I think the club is only open 2-3 nights per week, so may not even be an issue, depending on when you are staying.

525,KatieTags,Sep 2020,"We were there in July, about 4 weeks after Vegas reopened. The only day the pools were crowded was Saturday.

530,Keith F,Jul 2020,Personally I would choose the Chelsea Chelsea Tower. The Strip tower can be noisy. The same view from a Terrace suite can be booked for less money.,1

530,Novaturient,Jul 2020,"I think the Wraparounds on boulevard either facing south/east or north/East are best. North east you can see Bellagio fountains, Paris, and Planet Hollywood. While the strip can be loud is true, however, I once had a $50 upgrade 17th floor wraparound in the boulevard tower that faced south and west- which basically just faced the Chelsie building and Bellagios parking lot. Not the best. Boulevard is nice since elevators are in the center, and the tower is small so it‚Äôs not a long walk to the elevator. Maybe book wraparound and see if they will upgrade to fountain view at check-in?",0

532,Novaturient,Jul 2020,"It looks as if some travel sites offered a bed and breakfast version of booking at Cosmo that included 2 passes to Wicked Spoon buffet on the 2nd floor of the Chelsie tower. With so many places to eat in Las Vegas and the buffets still not opening yet the same way due to COVID, it is usually better to just book the room without breakfast. Less expensive and faster to just pick up something quick at District 16 on the 2nd floor, or Starbucks on the ground floor, or the Henry on the ground floor, or anywhere along the strip.",1

Chelsea Tower is right by the hotel lobby/check in desks, the Boulevard Tower is further down but closer to the Strip entrance. The Boulevard Tower is also where the outdoor pools are. I would recommend the Boulevard tower.",1
542,Iainh,Mar 2020,"We were on the 39th floor and in the boulevard tower, it‚Äôs the closest to the strip so has the best views in my opinion. Hope that helps",1

544,Klikuha,Mar 2020,It doesn‚Äôt matter as long as you have exposure to the fountain,1
544,Vetapong U,Feb 2020,Both have the view of the fountain. Most important thing is to be ON THE CORRECT SIDE of the building. So please make sure you ask for a room with both balcony and fountain view when you book (I think the room costs more but it's worth it!) and double check when you check-in!,1

South has a view of the MGM and south resorts and west overlooks the interstates and city. I loved the fountain view as we could open the window every 1/2 hour to enjoy the show until midnight. It's up to you, but I would go for the fountain view. If going for one night, are you staying out late? In early? We tried to get home earlier each night so we could enjoy our fountain view. It's like why stay in a deluxe Disney resort if we are spending every day, all day in the parks? Good luck.",1
548,Klikuha,Feb 2020,I paid $56 per day to upgrade for the fountain view and very happy because it‚Äôs worth every penny.,1

579,momtke003,Jul 3,We were there the first day of July and had no problem getting a lounger. It all depends where you want to be. No shade unless you pay for a cabana.,1
579,Aric M,Jul 1,"Yes and yes. The free chair do not have any shade or covering though. Also, they are numbered at the base so when you order food they know exactly which chair to deliver to.",1
579,AVJ,Jul 1,"Yes, there are a lot of free lounge chairs. Also, you can reserve if you want a specific area to be in. Weekdays are the best. May be a little busy on the weekends at the pools.",1

580,Maureen J,Jun 2022,Yes. No glass.,0

580,maryana672,Jun 2022,You can try but if the pool attendants see you - they may ask you to take back to your room. It really depends on who is working and how busy the pool area is.,0

580,Jean D,Jun 2022,"We sit in a area right off from the pool & drink our coffee in the morning & you can have snacks & drinks there, but inside I think they frown upon it because they want to sell you there food & drink at high prices. I am sure you would get away with small items in your bag.",0
580,TravisSharpe,Jun 2022,"We brought in a bag with drinks and snacks, but didn‚Äôt bring a full on cooler in. Not sure if they would frown on that or not. They do a bag search on the way in, but I think they are mostly looking for glass containers. I had a bottle of spiced rum I brought in but it was in a plastic bottle and they didn‚Äôt blink at it. Your mileage may vary.",0
580,Lana S,Jun 2022,I am not sure about the pool area. There is a small store inside the casino that you can purchase less costly drinks than those in your room or I have seen people uber to stores to buy supplies. They do have a bar at the pool so an ice chest may be taboo,0
580,Achik H,Jun 2022,When we were there we couldn't bring anything in. There was a guard at the pool entrance checking people's bags for drinks and food.,0
580,Susan U,Jun 2022,I always bring snacks. It‚Äôs never been an issue.,0
580,dar p,Jun 2022,There is a sign at the pool gate that says no outside food or drinks. They have a restaurant inside and you can order food and drinks poolside. Only food items they would allow would be baby food or milk.,0
580,playtoday2,Jun 2022,Sorry I don‚Äôt know. Call the resort they will answer that question,0
580,Don K,Jun 2022,"Quite honestly, I don‚Äôt know because we didn‚Äôt go to the pool. We have a pool in our backyard, so we never see a need to go to a hotel pool. Sorry",0

583,517marileeh,Jun 2022,I would say MGM. The lazy river is much nicer and longer.,0
583,Michael L,May 2022,"For me, Mandalay Bay!",0
583,Aaron l,May 2022,"Mandaly , its cleaner and the pools are better. both have a lazy river however mandaly has a wave pool as well. MGM lazy river is always so packed its not that much fun. Mandaly also has the Shark reef encounter . For gambling i would say dont gamble there. Slots are tight at both MGM and Mandalay and tables at both are expensive.",0
583,k2crosby,May 2022,Mandalay has best pool. Wave pool. Lazy river. But there is NO protection from sun so you will likely need a cabana which Is like $450. Michael Jackson One at Mandalay was one of the best shows I‚Äôve ever seen. Shark Reef. Good Restaurants and shops. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. It is a hike to center of strip. If you are looking to explore the strip be prepared to walk.,0
583,benzit0c,May 2022,"Mandalay Bay, you will love the beach area and Shark Reef!",0
583,Traveler56745307423,May 2022,"Mandalay Bay! Great pool with wave pool, lazy river and sandy beach. Shark reef aquarium exhibit is awesome. Plenty of restaurants and walking distance to other resorts to visit.",0
583,Elaine H,May 2022,"I have never stayed at MGM , but feel safe at Mandalay, stay there frequently.",0
583,gascharf,May 2022,"Well if the kids like games, Mandalay bay is walking distance to the pinball hall of fame. in general there are no real kid oriented resorts however NYNY just redid their arcade and roller coaster. what are the ages of the kids?",0
583,Todd P,May 2022,"We have stayed multiple times at both. Mandalay Bay overall is better to navigate and we love the restaurants. Pool is awesome but is very crowded which most are in Vegas. MGM can be a bit overwhelming since the monorail that goes most of the strip ends there so people going to NY NY, Excalibur, Luxor etc com thru MGM. Try to get higher floor at Mandalay‚Ä¶the views are great!",0
583,Mary H,May 2022,I prefer Mandalay Bay and I have stayed at MGM.,0
583,Annefrombham,May 2022,"Mandalay Bay is at the end of the strip with MGM being closer to the middle (not in the middle but closer). Mandalay Bay has a monorail that runs to the Excalibur, putting you close to the MGM. If you have people in your group that enjoys a wave pool and a lazy river Mandalay Bay has both of those and it is very nice. I haven't stayed at the MGM so I am not familiar with their pool situation. If you plan to use the lazy river I would suggest purchasing a cheap blowup ring float - one that you can leave. The ring floats they have are for purchase only and are either 30.00 or 45.00 each. I hope this helps.",0
583,Jnuakbear,May 2022,"I would stay at Mandalay Bay because of the pool. Easy access to the shops between Mandalay and Luxor and restaurant choices are great. The bathrooms at Mandalay are spacious and have a LARGE tub and a shower. I have not ever stayed at the MGM so I can't say, but Mandalay is where we usually stay.",0
583,armand0020576,May 2022,"Hi, I gave the option to my kids they we‚Äôre watching some videos on YouTube and they decided to go to Mandalay Bay instead of MGM because of the wave pool, for me MGM and Mandalay Bay are ok and let me tell you that the my wife and me enjoyed the pool area too. One thing that I didn‚Äôt like was the food options, MGM has a better variety for f food.",0
583,Shashashiii,May 2022,Mandalay is way better than MGM. Family friendly and fun for everyone. Everyone else is there for it too. Will be packed this summer. MGM is a lil more run down rooms and more for adults.,0
583,Brant F,May 2022,"depending upon the age of the kids, the wave pool would probably be better at Mandalay Bay and the aquarium as well.",0
583,SYK0180,May 2022,Mandalay Bay is more family-friendly and more things to do on-site.,0
583,Martin K,Apr 2022,"I've been to and enjoyed both. With kids, Mandalay Bay would be the better choice. It's more compact (the MGM has a sprawling layout) and the pool is perfect for kids. A lazy river that doesn't require a tube and a wave pool with sand. The pool at the MGM seems a little more adult oriented and party-esque, which is fun as well....",0
583,ccctint,Apr 2022,"I would recommend mandalay bay The wave pool and the lazy river is amazing , chairs fill quick do just get to the sandy beach area earlier than later also depending on time of year the sun is off the pool area mid to late afternoon Plus for kids the shark tank is pretty cool Been staying there for 15 years Absolutely love it there Cheers",0
583,David C,Apr 2022,"Both are MGM properties. The Mandalay has a better pool in theory‚Ä¶but is packed, lines form to get in at 8am. The lazy river tubes rent for $30. Few, if any, chairs or loungers. Littile to NO shade. Pool-side food? Expensive. Frankly, if you have older kids, I‚Äôd go MGM.",0
583,gabed12022,Apr 2022,"I would say 100% Mandalay Bay is a better choice. The kids will love the beach area with the wave pool, the lazy river, the aquarium and easy to get to Luxor and ex caliber with the Monorail.",0
583,vardolino23,Apr 2022,Mandalay. MGM is nice but more congested,0
583,Queenj101,Apr 2022,"Hi I‚Äôm not exactly sure because I have never stayed at MGM. It really depends on the experience you want to have. I would suggest Delano (which is adjacent to Mandalay but more of a boutique hotel) or further down at Aria, The Cosmopolitan, Bellagio, or if you‚Äôre on a budget MGM Park. My friend stayed at the Park and enjoyed it because of its location and less people than the MGM. You can always go across the street to the casino at MGM if you want to gamble. Hope this helps.",0
583,ram21,Apr 2022,For adults I would say both. MB has the topless 21+ pool which was awesome and fun for couples. MGM pools have more 21yr olds party style. Vegas is definitely not a family place.,0
583,Symphanie H,Apr 2022,"Definitely would recommend Mandalay Bay for a family, they have a better pool and the overall environment is more welcoming than MGM. Typically when we've stayed at Mandalay bay our experience was wonderful, this time just didn't meet our expectations... but I will stay again and again! Hope this helps",0
584,jamie D,May 2022,"No, most of the loungers are unavailable and to get shade you have to pay. They provide NO SHADE -for non payers $$$$. There is absolutely nowhere to sit that has shade if you don‚Äôt rent one of their expensive cabanas",0
584,Annefrombham,May 2022,"Try to find seating around the lazy river if that will work for you, more availability",0
584,deestar527,May 2022,Yes but you‚Äôll want to get there early as they are limited,0
584,Christine92602,Apr 2022,"There is some shade in areas under trees, but as the sun shifts IG would affect the shade. I do not remember umbrellas.",0
585,Michele,Apr 2022,"If it‚Äôs busy, you can‚Äôt find a chair to save your life! If you want to be sure to have a spot I would rent a cabana! Unless you send the kids down when the pool opens to grab chairs and put your stuff on them.",2

586,dvdkopp,Apr 2022,I don't believe for free,2
586,Shailynns,Apr 2022,"Although, it is possible, I believe you have to pay a fee. I recommend making a rewards account with MGM and download the app to have all the MGM‚Äôs information for their hotels.",1
586,mlr0bb0,Apr 2022,"I wouldn't follow a guest in unless being escorted off property by security happens to be on your bucket list. outsiders are allowed access to the pool parties but need to have a res, a ticket or be on a guest list (i.e. look good in a bikini) lol. They probably also sell day passes when not at max cap.",1
586,runningbrowndog,Apr 2022,"You must present a room key to open the glass door to get out to the pool area. However, you can just ""follow'' a hotel guest outside.

586,Pat T,Apr 2022,"When entering the pool area, they scan your room key to get in.... There are several restaurants in the conference & shark tank area that have patios that over look the pool area somewhat...",1
586,Neal Z,Apr 2022,Most of the Vegas hotels sold day passes for their pool areas pre-pandemic. You should contact the hotel directly to inquire if the passes are currently available,1
586,kathyhK9551WZ,Apr 2022,No! If you are staying at another MGM property. Go to your concierge and ask them to get you a pass. IF you are not staying at a MGM property probably not. You can not walk up and get in because Mandalay Bay is usually booked to the max. Always ask your concierge at your hotel what they can do for you.,0
586,jkaufman218,Apr 2022,No. You need a room key which they scan in order to enter.,0
586,nickgfust,Apr 2022,I believe that they will let you in if you are paying for some sort of reservation. That could be a lounge chair all the way up to a cabana. Would definitely call ahead and ask before making plans.,0
586,Christie H,Apr 2022,"No, you have to have a room key",0
586,gtimcarman,Apr 2022,They have normally have day passes to purchase for non hotel guests. If you are staying at a different MGM property they may offer a discounted rate.,0
586,Bo M,Apr 2022,"I‚Äôm not üíØ sure, but I think so. You should call the property to check.",0
586,HandicapableVet24,Apr 2022,No. Mandalay Bay does not provide access/day passes to non-guests. I believe you would need to reserve a lounge area/cabana to access their resort pool areas if you are not staying at their hotel. The same applies to other MGM properties. You can reserve online at the MGM resorts website.,0
586,hodgmancynthia,Apr 2022,I believe u can pay 50$ for a day pass.. but call to make sure!,0
587,kathyhK9551WZ,Apr 2022,It depends on the level of the room you are staying in. They have different accommodations and you can always ask for a coffee maker just like you ca always ask for a small refrigerator. There might be a fee involved.,1
587,Omar K,Apr 2022,Yes. There is a coffee maker in the room.,1
587,1jlh1973,Apr 2022,"If you attempt to use the mini coffee machine you will need your own cups, pods etc. The ones in the room are chargeable as noted in the prior comments.

591,RayDes58,Mar 2022,No resort fee is like a tax you can not use it as a credit. If you have a resort CREDIT. Then yes you can usually charge meals to the room and they will Be deducted from your credit.,1
591,Gary F,Mar 2022,The resort fees are a joke‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just another way for them to screw you. You don‚Äôt get anything for it except Wi-Fi Internet. Pretty expensive Internet per day isn‚Äôt it?,0
591,Tina K,Mar 2022,If you have an issue in the hotel they waive resort fee or part of it.,0
591,robert p,Mar 2022,"I do not think so. Resort fees are added to pay for all the splendor that surrounds you, including the pool. There‚Äôs a room fee, which is admirable for the great accommodations . The resort fee covers all those extras that give your stay the ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor. All resorts have them and if you go in hating them, you‚Äôll never appreciate all that is around you..",0

591,Yolanda G,Mar 2022,I think resort credits then yes when you dine charge to room and at checkout Hotel will deduct from your resort credit. Not every restaurant affiliates accept resort credits. Make sure you ask before you dine.,0
591,Glenda S,Mar 2022,I have no idea. We stayed one night and all we were told on checkout when I complained was that those fees would be ‚Äúrefunded.‚Äù They couldn‚Äôt even tell me the amount. But it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to ask I guess??,0

A couple of 'working girls' were trying to run a low profile while sidling up to older guys. There were some impressive boobs on some of the Russian men in speedos... a sight you just can't unsee no matter how hard you try. Not really my cup of tea...I'd say not worth it.,0
605,kenjoseph141414,Jan 2022,It can,0
606,Talemah J,Oct 2021,Pool will be open but you need to check if it will be heated by then. It does get a little breezy even though it my be 75 degrees. If you want a guaranteed lounge space you need to reserve ahead of time especially if you are going on a busy weekend. During the week you should be able to find one easily. They have two pool areas. One is the big day party (Morea) and the other is just the pool area.,2

607,joe m,Oct 2021,I stayed in July of 2021 and paid $600 a day to rent a cabana. The prices vary depending on what the hotel feels like they can get for the cabana. Busier days they're much more expensive.,0

608,pauljunk2021,Sep 2021,"There are a couple of rows of chairs that are open for the guests at no charge. The lounge chairs and the cabanas do have a charge. One item of note regarding the lounge chairs the cost does NOT include the umbrella. Overall, the service you receive at any price point is impeccable. You also received free water and ice service throughout the day as well.",2
608,John J,Sep 2021,In my recent visit in early September -- There were plenty of free chairs to be had. I had reserved a couple of the pay chairs (and paid for an umbrella--which was worth it IMO -- I would have been a fried mess otherwise). Ain't cheap for any of it (Vegas ya know). $75/chair/day to reserve $50 for the umbrella (that staff came by and adjusted throughout the day). If you love the sun and don't care about blocking it -- you will have access to plenty of chairs.,2
608,charityoverton,Sep 2021,They have some you can reserve. But we just sat in the free ones. They had plenty available the day we were there.,1
608,RetiredIBEW,Sep 2021,Most chairs are free but you can purchase some in prime locations. Stop by your local store and buy a tube for $5.00 to $10.00 because they cost $28.00 at the pool.,1
608,jfrdrch,Sep 2021,"Yes and no. There is free seating but you'd better get there early to snag one. The paid seats have cushions, are closer to the water and have dedicated servers to bring you food and drinks. Umbrellas are also only available only for the paid seats but they cost additional over and above the cost of the chair itself.",1
608,Randy F,Sep 2021,"The pool side chairs with umbrellas cost $150 for the day, it comes with a bucket of ice and 4 waters, but you have shade all day and a dedicated waitress helping you throughout the day, a little pricey but it was a nice thing for the four of us.",1
608,ROBIN C,Sep 2021,I‚Äôm not 100% certain but I don‚Äôt think you do. Because people line up before the pool even opens so they can get chairs,1
608,Kris B,Sep 2021,Only in certain areas. You do not need to pay for a chair,1
608,Stani B,Sep 2021,I don't think so. Just be wary of outside area with regards to heat of sand and asphalt. Wear shoes,1

608,shari s,Sep 2021,"I was there a few weeks ago late Aug, there were plenty of free open chairs your average off white strap lounge chairs throughout the pool area. You have to consider the time of the year you are going...schools back in session etc...not as many families with children. There were tags on the free chairs so if you ordered food from one of the passing pool attendants they knew who ordered. We usually went down about 9: 30 10:00 sitting at the West Pool, not hard to find seat. There were people already sitting out in the sun. It did start to fill up more as the day progressed. You pay for the red chairs and umbrellas at the wave pools edge, or the large round chairs and cabanas.",0

608,jfrdrch,Sep 2021,"Also as an added benefit, and the reason I got one last year, is that due to Covid they started restricting pool occupancy BUT if you bought a chair or cabana they let you in no matter what so there was no waiting or being turned away!",0
608,Carson M,Sep 2021,Cabana chairs do.. and you reserve them thats what I would suggest other seating is first come first serve,0

640,chrisc1981elp,May 2021,Yes they have non connecting rooms. It's a smoke free hotel. However you will always have someone braking the rules.,0
640,angela j,Oct 2020,Mandalay Bay is a stream Wonderful hotel and totally smoke-free Hotel besides being outside you should smell marijuana inside the building anywhere however marijuana is legal in Las Vegas so you might have to just take your chances but they are only a couple of smoking hotels in Vegas I know the Bellagio is one of them,0
640,mbrichter,Oct 2020,"If you are asking to have a room that does not have a door that connects to another room, even if it is to remained locked, I don't think that is possible except in a suite. If you just don't want your room to be connected with another room occupied by people you're travelling with, you just need to request it. However, request it before you arrive, as far in advance as possible. If you're travelling with a large group this may have been pre-arranged and you may not be able to change it. Also, make sure you can live with any upset feelings it may cause the people you're travelling with. The ""Weed Free"" floor is probably going to be a problem. At this time, vaping is not considered smoking in Las Vegas, so it happens on Smoke Free floors also. We were on a smoke free floor in August and it smelled like weed 24 hours a day. Additionally, there is no such thing as ""weed free"" in Las Vegas right now. The smell of pot hangs i the air everywhere you go. I saw more weed being smoked in a day in Las Vegas than in the month I lived in Amsterdam. Of course, if you can't beat 'em, you can always join 'em. Then the smell won't bother you as much.",0

The elevators were not as busy so it was easy to wait for the next one and social distance.

651,R3C0NXD45,Jul 2020,"I can‚Äôt say for sure about the fitness center but you do not have to wear a mask at the pool provided you‚Äôre sunbathing or in the pool. They do limit the number of people in the lazy river (never a long line for us but we went during the week) and provide masks to wear in the line for the lazy river. If you‚Äôre goin over the weekend (or if things may have changed during the week) you‚Äôll want to get to the pool early or swing by the pool before you want to go so you can check in to the online waitlist (open your camera and point it at the QR code then open the website link). We got there Sunday at the beginning of July and there were waitlists for the pool that day, anywhere from a half hour to an hour and a half but the rest of the week we never had to wait. They will also provide masks as you leave the pool area and have masks and hand sanitizers at the entrances and exists of the hotel and casino. They are also (or at least we‚Äôre but I‚Äôd assume still are) restricting the pool to hotel guests exclusively to keep the waits and congestion down. My only advice is to be aware of the wait times on the weekends but we had a blast and are very happy we went. Good luck!",1

MGM Resorts International president and acting CEO Bill Hornbuckle tells the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Excalibur will reopen on June 11, while demand could be high enough by the Fourth of July for Aria to come back. Excalibur plans to reopen its slide pool and the Drenched Pool Cafe, the Fun Dungeon Arcade, as well as some of its bars and restaurants. Hotel guests also will have access to the fitness center. He predicts that the gaming giant‚Äôs four other resorts ‚Äî Luxor, Mandalay Bay, the Mirage, and Park MGM ‚Äî could roll out on a biweekly or monthly basis after that.

The resort is also less congested and quiet . The rooms are much bigger at Mandalay Bay for a family as well with separate shower and tub area. The Luxor is attached by shops and food area. The Excalibur has a whole circus carnival type area kids would enjoy and the Excalibur knight show is fabulous for families as well and comes with dinner and drink.if you wish to visit strip there is a free tram for Mandalay Bay to Excalibur. From Excalibur you can walk to Park hotel across street and take a free tram to Belligio from there.,2

693,M Q,Jan 2022,Was there in November and never once had a waitress come and offer drinks. I didn‚Äôt go in the high stakes room so that may be different but on the main floor nothing! Black Jack tables also had min stakes of $50 so quite expensive.,0
693,Justin G. S,Jan 2022,"Complimentary drinks are readily available via hostesses walking around the various areas within ARIA but, to the best of our knowledge, the Tower Suites Lounge has not yet reopened. While the drinks are complimentary, one is expected to tip the hostess accordingly.",0

697,Patricia L,Nov 2021,All lounges are open,2
697,kat42592015,Nov 2021,"There are two separate lounges, one is for Aria suites and I don't know what the other one is called, maybe, sky lounge. I can't remember what the two lounges are called. But it's for people who have upgraded rooms. I always had the lower level lounge which is right at the entrance of aria. When I was there in July, it was not open, but the other lounge was. They did not let us utilize it though. As I mentioned, I was there in July, it just was not the same. We typically never made reservations for dinner when we would come during previous years, we found ourselves scrambling at dinner time trying to find something that was open and had availability. Also, I have a gold level, that really was not recognized to get you into a restaurant without waiting 45 minutes. Make sure you have an Open table app, that will help. Not having the buffet open which we used to use every morning when we would stay there was disappointing. I still don't think it's open. During our stay, calling down to the front desk, no one ever answered the phone. The only people that ever answered the phone was housekeeping. That was it. I guess everyone is doing the best they can during these times, so we just kind of accepted what we had to deal with. I don't regret going, I never complained to anyone, but it just wasn't the same. Nothing is the same anywhere.",1
697,DjfSafari58555360130,Nov 2021,"They are still open? It was a rambling shell of a hotel my last trip. I think the lounge was open, at least the pool one was I recall.

697,M Q,Nov 2021,"Yes it is open but if you haven‚Äôt been before please don‚Äôt get too excited as it‚Äôs just a few seats by the reception area. Yes soft drinks are complementary which is a bonus but the snacks served are small pastries that would be ok at breakfast yet are served all day. The VIP pool is closed and no food served round the pool during the day which is why we selected this hotel. The biggest issue is that after we checked out the hotel have taken several unauthorised payments and we have had no response or explanation from them, a week later I am still waiting a refund and my bank is now investigating them for fraud!",1

699,Chay W,Oct 2021,"I don't recall any heated pools (other than the hot tubs). Some pools are private and you pay to enter those pool areas, so I wouldn't doubt if they are heated.

700,LIDIA W,Jun 2021,I think if you decide to keep the robe from your room they usually charge you around $75 in the majority of the hotels. But you can also order a new one from them at the front desk or housekeeping to buy it. Hope it helps.,0

731,Mark S,Aug 2020,"I just got back from Vegas for a week and stayed at the Mandalay Bay. The trip prior, I stayed at Aria. I went to the pool daily at Mandalay the entire first week of August. There were no issues whatsoever getting a lounge chair any day I was there. Very few people in Vegas right now. Many resorts casinos on the are still closed and some may not even reopen. There is so much capacity in Vegas for major crowds and you're probably down right now 80% minimum over last year. In September, as long as you plan on getting there a few minutes before they open, you're 100% fine. Mandalay's Pool opened at 9am daily and I would say had a line up of only about 30-40 people daily waiting to get in, and those were people that really wanted a specific chair by a specific pool. There are so few people in Vegas now, that as far as I know, never had to restrict any people coming in at Mandalay due to their 50% occupancy restriction. You have to understand, Vegas is dead now. People are so afraid to travel unfortunately when it's been the safest it's ever been. Temperature checks in the resort to check-in, temperature checks to board a plane, masks required everywhere you go. I mean the chances of getting ill are essentially zero. The Strip is not crowded. Casinos are all relatively empty on the Strip. Things start to pick up on Friday's but it's still not at all crowded. When I left Vegas yesterday, Nevada only had 700 new cases of Covid state-wide, so they are doing quite well and restrictions may be less by the time you go. Unless you are going Labor Day weekend, I would say reserving a day bed/Cabana is absolutely not needed, unless you want that additional comfort and premium experience. I had an awesome vacation and won a lot of money, hope you do as well!",3

733,Michael M,Jul 2020,"Yes. The hold is for incidentals, room charges, etc. you can charge to your room from most every MGM property.",0

764,Boopbabe23,Aug 2019,"Hi: So I absolutely LOVED this hotel. That being said I had comp nights but I still think it's worth it if I had the money. If you join the Mlife rewards program for free they usually give you discount offers. But the hotel was great, we were on the 17th floor in a strip view and when you walk in the door the curtain opens to reveal the view. They have a lot of automated features like the goodnight feature that closes the curtains and turns the lights off, the bathroom is great with double sinks, a huge bathtub and separate shower, nice closet area and drawer space, a sitting area, and plugs for your phone right next to the bed which a lot of hotels don't have, the staff was great as well and we liked the general vibe of the aria. It is also a quick walk to Park MGM and there is a tram to bellagio. I don't know if the pool was heated, I didn't go in, but it was 111 degrees there when I was there so I would think it would be refreshing not heated, but if you are going at a cooler time you would probably want it heated and I am not sure if they do heat it when it is cooler. I know the pools are usually closed from around Nov-Feb ish but depends on the resort. There were not a lot of kids at the pool when I went and aria has 3 pools and there is also a pool where you can rent chairs. The pools to avoid if you don't want to deal with kids are for sure MGM and Mandalay because they have the Lazy rivers, and Excalibur usually has a lot of kids too. Also if you want something a little cheaper but still nice mirage is another one we like but we only like the tower rooms. We usually book a regular room and then most of the time can get a tower room for another $20 a night but not always. The tower rooms are on a high floor and have a separate bath and shower and the tub is huge and double sinks, it also has private elevators. I wouldn't recommend the regular mirage rooms as they need updating and the bathroom is teeny tiny.",1
764,Denise D,Aug 2019,"I did not see many children, and we were not at the adults only pool. The days were over 100 degrees, while the water seemed cool compared to the outside temperature, I'm fairly certain the pool was heated. The pool was comfortable.",0

I do get to the pool right around 8:00, put out our towels and magazines, then we go to breakfast and for a short walk and come back. We have always traveled in July so I can‚Äôt speak for crowdedness of pool other times of year. During our most recent stay the zero depth pool was hardly crowded while we were there from 9-2. We do not frequent the other pool as we like to sit in the zero depth pool. (There are 4 pools including Liquid and Sky) they provide towels and are happy to give extra.

Check out time was at 11AM and we were able to get until 12PM complimentary. After that they told us it would be $40 to check out at 1 and $60 to check out at 4. I have never had it be that high at a hotel, usually I get offered 1PM for $15 and 3PM for $30 but it depends on the hotel and how busy they are. If you do check out they will store your luggage for free so you don't have to carry it with you for the day if you want to do something you can come back and get your luggage later in time to go to the airport.",0
768,David R,Jul 2019,They will allow you free up to 1pm I believe otherwise its $50 which should give you until 4pm.,0

The bell desk is just outside the lobby and you collect them at the Park MGM end of the casino so you can just jump in a taxi from there. There's not much difference in price between an Uber and taxi back to McCarran so rather than trail your bags back into the casino and downstairs for an Uber, I would just take a taxi.",1

784,William G,May 2022,"The Resort tower apparently has older decor and the Royal is more recently renovated, but the flip side is you are far closer to the paid self-park area and the pool in the Resort tower. So if you aren't there mainly for the Vegas strip, the Resort tower allows easier access to your vehicle. If you're there to go to the strip, the North Resort Tower, and the east Royal tower are closest, but the way the elevators are placed, the Royal tower is the shorter walk. As to views, considering only the ""outside rooms"" (the ones not looking to the interior of the complex) I like the west side of the Resort tower because you aren't just looking at casino buildings or the airport (nor much else in some ways), but you can even keep an eye on your car if you park it on the top floor of the parking structure. The Royal tower South side has no special views unless you like looking at Luxor and Mandalay Bay hotels, or the airport. The Royal Tower east side looks toward Henderson, but there are a few other resorts in the way, like OXO. The Resort tower North side, looks toward New York, New York Hotel Casino, and the MGM Grand, which are at least a little bit further away than the southside views and kind of interesting architecture. There are also rooms on the ""inside"" of each of the towers. These have essentially no views, they look on the roof of the casino, food and shopping area and the other towers.",0
784,anrgsxr,May 2022,"I would say Resort Tower. They're both about the same as far as the rooms go, although it seemed to be that the bathroom was larger in the resort tower.

786,ChristopherD007,Apr 2022,10 AM to 5 PM are the current pool hours from what I can find online.,0
786,ChristopherD007,Apr 2022,"Pools are opening, check with the hotel, when some pools are closed they don't mind guests using other hotel pools assuming it's the same corporate ownership. Be sure to check your room closely to be sure it's adequate, don't be afraid to ask for a new room or an upgrade.",0
786,Aimee,Apr 2022,"We‚Äôve stayed at the Excalibur for years. I was there in March and the pools were open. We had 2 rooms and everything was very clean and functioning with no issues. Don‚Äôt expect a luxury experience, but we always have a good experience.",0
786,dshank1982,Apr 2022,The pool areas are beautiful so I'm sure they should be open. The service down at the casinos is horrible though. Waitresses are rude as heck and you will never get a drink while you are gambling. Atleast that was the case for us.,0
786,carindgabe,Apr 2022,"I have stayed at Excalibur for many yrs , but this last time I stayed was the worst absolute worse experience!!!! The shower would not drain when I was showering so I basically showered in dirty water . We called to tell them and they came in and the maintenance guy took all the stuff it had in the drain which was absolutely disgusting ü§Æ and he said I wouldn‚Äôt go in there and just left the mess like that ! Like WTF ? I do not plan on staying there again !",0
786,DeisiBarr,Apr 2022,I was there April 18th and pools were in fact open. Everyone seemed to be enjoying them. I had no issues and the mobile app check in is very convenient,0
786,ShanMak,Apr 2022,They will have at least one pool open. I was there the first week of April the tropical water slide pool is closed for renovation. There was another large beautiful pool that they only opened on weekends and it until noon. That left one small pool and another pool you had to pay to enter. We were told the other was based on spa out in the casino. If the casino was full they‚Äôd open another pool. Kinda sucks when this is a place you go with your family that is too young to gamble!,0
786,Chad C,Apr 2022,One pool and both hottubs are open diring week. Only during weekend are voth pools open.,0
786,Passport678617,Apr 2022,One of the pools was open when we were there but the others were closed. They also don't stay open very far into the evening which was very disappointing when you have had a long day and want a swim to relax and wind down.,0
786,Dr Frank P,Apr 2022,"I am confident that the pool will be open in May. The pool area is nice at this hotel. Do not be overly concerned with the negative reviews. I just retuned from a week in Vegas and stayed at Treasure Island. It really was not any better than the Excalibur. Good service in LV is the exception, not the norm. It seems that we now have to settle for the ""best of the worst."" Hope this helps, enjoy your trip! FWP",0
786,niquaa92,Apr 2022,I was there the first week of march for 6 days and not all pools were open but 2 out of the 4 was. I never have a problem with excalibur i stay there everytime i come to vegas and we always have a good time its around alot. And you get your money worth,0

786,eldorado831,Apr 2022,"You can call and ask. I don't see why it wouldn't be open. I stay at the Excalibur a lot and I think it's great. The pool, gambling, the food. Plus you're connected to the MGM, luxer, and New York New York. I don't know why people leave bad reviews, probably sore losers.",0
786,Sdy2015,Apr 2022,The pool was open when we were there in December. We enjoyed our stay there as a family. I read some bad reviews too and started to question my choice but we were very happy with everything especially location!,0
786,smontesitx,Apr 2022,I agree with Arieana D - cancel.,0
786,Seaside581517,Apr 2022,The pools slide was closed when we were there a few weeks ago! The pools were ok.. you have to get there early to get a seat. Two days the pool was closed for us due to a sand storm I went to the front desk and complained they then sent us to MGM - their pool was amazing! I would never stay at Excalibur again!

786,Tanya Tolliver,May 2022,Yes 2 of the pools are open 10 am to 5pm. Crowded though,-1
786,Brandi N,May 2022,We were there Sun-thurs and went to the pool on Wed. They only had the small Kid pool open because they don‚Äôt have enough lifeguards. They told me they only open the rest of the pools on the weekends because high school lifeguards can work then. They just didn‚Äôt have enough help. This caused the one pool to be very crowded. Sad,-1
786,mdagdesigns,Apr 2022,You may want to call ahead of time. It's pool season now so rules may have changed for hours opened. We had a great time there.,-1

786,DianneP1989,Apr 2022,"We were super excited about the pools and chose the hotel particularly because of the pools, but once we got there, there was so much to do and see we literally never even walked out to see them. We saw them from upstairs and they looked beautiful, but with all of the many things to do and the short time of our visit, going to a pool rapidly fell down our list. We did talk to guys in the elevator though that had just come from the pool and said it was awesome and they were having a great time there.",-1
786,Pam W.,Apr 2022,Pool was closed on my visit but grounds look nice. My room overlooked the area. Might want to take a single Keurig if you drink coffee.,-1
786,mdisant0,Apr 2022,"yes, the pool was open and it is huge. They have a couple of bars and food places out there as well, but the downside is they close it all down at 1700, pretty dumb if you ask me.. And after I called and complained about the lack of amenities in room, they said I could have asked for them to bring a fridge to the room. No one tells you that up front....",-1
786,Tina B,Apr 2022,One of the pools was open when we were there in March. We didn't use it though.,-1
786,Rinavelezdark,Apr 2022,The pool is open. Unfortunately there's a foul sewer smell from the restrooms in the pool area.,-1
786,emailgirl13,Apr 2022,I was the first week of April and 2 out of 4 pools and 2 hot tubs were open. One of the regular pools and the adults only pool. If you want to splash around or just sit in the water then it is fine. I went with my 9 yo and she had fun. The regular pool is only about 4 ft deep. Not enough lounge chairs so plan to find a space to dump your stuff or pay $$ for chairs or $$$ for a cabana.,-1
786,tbratn,Apr 2022,"The pools are unpredictable at this time of year. My suggestion is to head over to Circa downtown. Pay a $10 entry fee and enjoy the pool there. It's full of large screen tv's, plenty of sites, drinks everywhere and a good time. Again, this is not a relaxing environment, but it is one of the newest and most exciting pool in Vegas. Oh yeah, they stay open till 11pm. Most other pools in Vegas close between 5 - 7pm.",-1

786,Jasmine W,Apr 2022,"I think it will depend on the weather and staffing. I too booked because the pool area looked like a lot of fun. During my stay, the pool hours were very limited. I believe on the days it was opened, hours of operation were like 10am - 4 or 5pm, and was only posted at the pool entrance. One day it closed even earlier, like around 1/1:30. One day only one pool was open. The other day, 2 pools were open. The slide was not open at all to hotel guests. Kids and I were very disappointed. I will say this, I‚Äôm not sure if this is the case for all hotels there, but I know for a fact Mandalay Bay had abbreviated hours during my visits as well. Hope this helps.",-1
786,Muriel A,Apr 2022,"I know what you mean. The pools look great on the property map! There are three pools and a couple of hot tibs. One of the pools is gated. It's a VIP pool that you have to pay extra for. The largest pool is only open on the weekends (Fri, Sat, Sun). That leaves one pool, which obviously gets crowded. I did manage to swim when I was there. The water temperature is perfect. Another thing: the pool closes at 5, which i found disappointing. Bear in mind that this is probably the cheapest hotel on the Strip. The location is great, rooms are spacious, everything works, staff is friendly and helpul, so reviewers shouldn't be so picky. It's not the Bellagio, but not the Bellagio's price tag either.",-1

789,Amanda T,Mar 2022,Where our room was we had to use the Royal Tower Elevators. That side and area has access to the back side of hotel and parking area.

794,Sebastian B,Mar 2022,"I do not know which on is the 18+. I would guess that it is one of the smaller ones. The pool was closed for maintenance when I was there Feb 28-Mar 3. Cabanas and beds are always best booked in advance, and it's generally cheaper.",0

I said I don't have much good to say about the place and some of the people, which I would write about on Tripadvisor. If we ever go back we'll never stay there, even though we were refund our stay money. However, not the 26 dollars per day parking fee. 26 dollars a day to park while you spend hundred of dollars inside.

805,Tiffers88,Jun 2021,I‚Äôd be careful there. When we were there and did the self parking once in the hotel there‚Äôs a little remodeling being done and it‚Äôs only stairs (3). I even commented while I was there that there wasn‚Äôt a ramp or anything for wheelchairs.,1
805,Brian G,Sep 2021,Afraid I don't know. Call the casino for info,0
805,Carrie J,Jul 2021,I would recommend staying somewhere else. I stayed here twice in the past year and both times the room was dirty and the last time there was a leak in the bathroom ceiling and no one came to fix it. Sty away until they get their customer service fixed and their rooms upgraded.,0

836,D Johnson,Apr 2020,All the resorts that we have been to require a credit or debit card to hold for incidentals. We usually call the resort to find out what their card hold fees are and buy a Visa reloadable card with that amount on it. We have never had a problem with any resort taking the reloadable cards as an incidentals hold card.,3
837,kaukau,Apr 2020,"The Resort fee is $35 a night + $4.68 tax = 39.68 per night. It is paid at the Front Desk when you arrive. The deposit charge for ""incidentals"" is $50 per day. You may use any VISA/MasterCard credit or debit card as long as it is issued by a major bank. (No gift cards.) UK is fine. Your choice of currency: Pounds Sterling or dollars. If you make your reservation through the hotel's website - preferred method - your card will be charged your first night's room rate. cancel up to 72 hours prior to arrival. You will be asked which currency you prefer. The deposit charge you reference allows you to charge stuff to your room and any damages to your room. If you pay the deposit with a debit card and incur no charges, it takes two weeks to refund, If you pay the deposit with a credit card the charges are immediately removed like it never happened. Further, if you do not intend to charge anything to your room you may ask to have the security deposit waived. Whether or not they will oblige that request differs from hotel to hotel, is entirely up to the Front Desk manager, and is determined on a case by case basis. Anything else? Happy to help! PS Love The Sweeney and Inspector Morse!!!",3

849,DeviousMatty,Feb 2020,I went in Nov and from Terminal 3 to the Excalibur was $19 before tip. At the minute there are flat prices for taxis from the airport to the strip so your cost should be the same as I paid. Uber/Lyft are both available at the airport and would be a cheaper or there are the shuttle options.,1
849,Diane,Feb 2020,"We got the shuttle bus which was very easy, when you go out of the airport terminal there is a booth, sorry I cannot remember the cost but it wasn't expensive ,it was cheaper to book the return journey at the same time.

If you are staying at the Excalibur make sure you check out Baja Fresh and the food court upstairs. The Chinese restaurant (Pick up Stix) was amazingly good as were Aunt Annie's pretzels.

They also charge you an ""incidental fee"" and they want $200 which they also put against your credit card. If you put up a fight they will lower it to $100, but they insist on this charge. I will tell you this: we went to the Fremont Experience down at the old end of the strip. The Golden Nugget is an older hotel - BUT THEY HAVE NO RESORT FEES!!! and the food is much cheaper down there.",0
860,kmacdun,Jan 2020,"It depends if you gamble or not? Or if you drink a lot. I budget $150 per day that‚Äôs for food, drinks, and sight seeing/show etc. Obviously I don‚Äôt do a show everyday or pay for sight seeing everyday as a lot is free but I would get 3 shows/sight seeing per week out of that on top of drinks and food. Hope this helps",1
860,Gaylemae,Jan 2020,"Locate the half price show ticket booth near M & M world on the strip. Plan the shows you‚Äôd like to see. I highly recommend the free Ka tour held several weekdays where you get a discount coupon afterwards. Ka was wonderful but very long. Worth the price, from any seat. Next to Hard Rock Cafe is a gift store that sells liquor, buy water & alcohol there. Bring a drink bottle so you stay hydrated. Ask concierge for info on shuttle that goes up & down the strip, so you don‚Äôt have to drive/park car.",0
860,Tiptonits,Jan 2020,"There were 2 of us and we found the cheapest food possible without having to walk too far. I have a bad knee and it is difficult for me to walk a lot. We spent NO LESS than $100 PER DAY FOR FOOD!! We were there for 2 days and I limited myself to $100 for gambling, when that was gone, I was done. We took the Hoover Dam Tour and it was the best part of our entire trip. Look for the cheapest Hoover Dam Tour - it is the best one there!!!",0
860,BoardingPass733971,Jan 2020,"It all depends on how much you want to spend..food isn't expensive there compared to where you are. Conversion is the key! Don't forget hotels have various charges like resort fee, and parking so watch out for that.",0
861,883lynndam,Jan 2020,Sign up at home before you leave. That way when you book your shows you will already have an m life number to use in case there are discounts.,1
861,Matty,Jan 2020,The sooner you sign up the better,0
861,Jason M,Jan 2020,The sooner you sign up the sooner you can start saving money. It‚Äôs good at several hotels restaurants and attractions. Every dollar you spend you get rewards for and you can use them for your hotel rooms or use them to gamble with.,0
861,Cwulfing,Jan 2020,"Mlife rewards is a great program. Sign up for it and go get your card as soon as you get there. The same card is good for all the MGM properties Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, NYNY, Park MGM, MGM Grand, Aria, Bellagio, and Circus Circus as well. Save your receipts from everything you eat and purchase at any of these places and turn them in at any Mlife desk. If you want to increase points as fast as possible, bill everything to your room whenever you can. If I were you, I'd sign up online and purchase tix for the first show you want to see. After arrival, I would go to the concierge or box office to inquire about additional shows. I have always been well taken care of there. Have fun and enjoy!!",0
861,David L,Jan 2020,You should probly sign up now and you can actually download some slot games that will earn you M life points before you even arrive. As soon as you check in around the corner from there is the M life rewards card center you should pick up your card and make sure you use it every time you gamble in every machine to get as many points as you can. And if you Are enrolled before you even get there they may send you some promotions for the shows that you're intrested in before your arrival.,0
862,kmacdun,Jan 2020,"I‚Äôve known and met people who went to Vegas alone. In fact I know people who go in groups and in couples and do a lot alone. There are always people in casinos, walking, seeing shows and drinking alone. It won‚Äôt be unusual. My tip if you want to talk to people is sit at the bar when you‚Äôre having food/drinks as you always get chatting to other people! You‚Äôll have a great time",1
862,Cwulfing,Jan 2020,"In my humble opinion, Excalibur is the best hotel for the money on the strip. It is part of MGM properties so get a players club card. You will accrue points at most strip properties. I've stayed at many of the strip hotels over the last 25 years and a lot has changed. I tried Luxor (against the request of my friend who has worked there for 30 years). Yep, should have listened to him. Aria and Bellagio are beautiful but very very spendy. I have stayed at NYNY several times and honestly cannot discern much of a difference between their rooms and the Royal tower rooms at Excalibur. MGM Grand was ok. No better in my opinion to the remodeled rooms in the Royal towers at Excalibur. Excalibur is made up of 4 main towers. 2 are the resort towers which I have heard aged not so gracefully. The other 2 are the Royal towers which have been remodeled in the last few years and are on par with NYNY or MGM Grand. Uber is really affordable in Vegas and the 3 card poker at the Flamingo has earned me a lot of new friends (Canadians and Aussies among them). On the cheap, Casino Royale has multiple places to eat, very very cheap drinks and has lots of machines and tables. It's the last family owned property on the strip so I always visit there. That is always a good time. If you are looking for a fun atmosphere, cross the bridge and go 1 property north to NYNY from Excalibur and check out the bar at times square. I promise you will have a good time there. It's a large sing along piano bar and always a really fun place to visit. As far as Excalibur goes, I stayed there 4 times in 2019 and never had a ""bad"" room. My father came along once and my brother and his wife 3 times and their experiences were like mine. Make sure you are in the Royal towers. Call and upgrade if you are not. Have fun!!!",1
862,Noe P,Jan 2020,"Yo mate! You picked a decent hotel. It's at an okay location, from there you go north and have all the strip. You'll be fine mate, liquor courage all the way. Let me know if you have any more questions, I love talking Vegas, been there 12 times since 2012.",1
862,robert1976x,Jan 2020,Where is there to go for good entertainment near or around the excalibur hotel?? Good crowd and party atmosphere??,0
862,greglI7128BD,Jan 2020,"I go to Las Vegas 3-4 times per year. If money is not an option, I would stay at the Delano, which is an MGM property connected to Mandalay Bay. The Wynn or Encore are also great options- they are both owned by Steve Wynn and are also connected. The resort and rooms are awesome and the food is great. If you are on more of a budget I would look at the Luxor, New York New York, Mandalay Bay or MGM Grand. The Excalibur is a dump. My family all had bug bites from sleeping there. We only stayed there because my sons whole baseball team stayed there for a tournament. The casino floor and restaurants are in good shape, but the rooms are gross. I would never stay there again. Have fun!",0

863,Tiptonits,Jan 2020,"NO - they want you spending your money in their food court!! You might consider staying at the Golden Nugget. An older hotel, but they have NO RESORT FEES and the food is much cheaper down at that end of the strip. It is an OLDER PART OF VEGAS and there are a lot more homeless down there.",0

864,Dan D,Jan 2020,"I just used a cab for my family of 3 since it had plenty of room for all of our luggage, and the cab ride is now fixed price for all destinations on the strip. It was $19.00 to get to the Excalibur.",0
864,Cwulfing,Jan 2020,"We sometimes get a car, other times use Uber. If you do get a car, this hotel is unique as soon as you have achieved the second level of Mlife (Pearl), which does not take much, you get free self parking in the surface lot immediately adjacent the ride share pickup just off las vegas blvd. That lot is a 20 second walk from the elevators for the royal towers and you can be on las vegas blvd in 30 seconds. It's very unique for a strip hotel to have a surface lot so close to it these days.",0
864,Siddharth B,Jan 2020,"Uber/Lyft on the way up and WAX bus on the way back. Uber is not that expensive. 10-15$ or so. It's at the end of the strip, so we used Deuce bus to travel within the strip as Excalibur has it's own stop.WAX buses aren't very frequent, but are direct express lines. They stop at the front of Tropicana hotel opposite the MGM Grand sign of Steve Aoki performing. From here, it's supposed to be a 4-minute walk but with all the confusing pedestrian overground walkways it can get 10 minutes or more.",0

Then depending on where your room is you will have to walk left or right to get to the elevator to you room. So there is a lot of walking at the Luxor. But in Vegas there is a lot of walking anyway. Good exercise for all that food!,1
884,dotchick0802,Apr 2022,It depends on where you walk and where you park in the garage. Is it like a mile and a half away? No. But it can be a substantial walk. Perhaps 10 minute walk. As far as feet I really couldn‚Äôt tell you. But if you‚Äôre coming during the summer months when it‚Äôs 115¬∞ outside and there‚Äôs no shade you‚Äôre going to wish that you valet for $15 a day.,1
884,Mike H,Apr 2022,"Real distance is about 200 meters, its a walkway, accros the street, elevator available, but better to park on the roof, direct access to the walkway. Then you enter the Hotel on the backside/Poolside and you have to walk through the hotel to reception. With the carpet its a pull with your luggage, but you will get there. Enjoy",1
884,Alex A,May 2022,"depending on how far from the entrance, you walk down a 500 foot walkway that is covered but has openings to the outside and then because it is a casino. You walk all the way through the casino to check in. So a good five minutes and it is all ramped for wheel chairs.",0
884,Amanda Trujillo,Apr 2022,"It‚Äôs not much of a walk if you park on the top. I‚Äôm disabled so I was worried too. It‚Äôs not to bad. However, you will get the smell of Marijuana up there. What we did was parked and used Uber everywhere so we only had to pay the price once. If you take a taxi and they take you a scenic route to wherever your going you do not have to pay them. It‚Äôs against the law. Hopefully this will give you more insight.",0

884,Cindy S,Apr 2022,From the front registration area to self parking is about a 5 minute walk. Not that far. There is a way to get free parking. If you get their credit card you get free parking. My friends did that. Look into that.,0

Everything on the strip is a distance between each other. However, I do know that the Jitney Bus on the strip is basically all you need while traveling up and down the strip. It does cost about $20 per person for 3 -4 days but it's very convenient. Have a fantastic time!",0
884,Linda N,Apr 2022,"It's not that far. I have a knee injury so was initially concerned about the distance when I booked a night at the hotel. The self park is located next to the hotel. You access the parking by crossing an access road or a pedestrian bridge. I was lucky enough to find a parking spot on the bottom level, very close to the access road and hotel. If you drive to the top of the parking structure, there are some uncovered parking spaces that are very close to the pedestrian bridge. I also requested a room close to the pedestrian bridge because sometimes the walking required through the hotel and casino can be a long trek!",0

884,wsullivan541,Apr 2022,The guest parking lot is on the top of the parking garage. It‚Äôs a pretty big lot so the distance to the Walkway will depend on where you park.

After that is the parking structure. So it is a few hundred yards or about a block and a half. Another review said to park on the roof of the parking structure. You should only do that between October and early May. The temperature exceeds 100-110 during the summer. Parking in the sun might be a bad idea.",0
884,Liam K,Apr 2022,"It's as far from check in desk as possible, if you can mobile check in then you can at least avoid that. As there are different elevators or should i say inclinators for different floors. As far as garage to check in, it is probably a 10 min walk",0

No fridge in the room either which kinda sucked. we used out ice bucket. Window washer comes by early Friday am.

The second most important point is which side of the building is the window facing. You want to face the strip for the best viewing.

That being said, when we were there, we seen the tram operate occasionally, but it seems to be at a reduced frequency.

914,BeachBumBunny,Jan 2021,"None of the rooms have jacuzzis. That includes the suites. The suites used to have jacuzzis but they took them out about 5-6 years ago. There is just a soaking tub. I was there January 1, 2021 and the hotel said that we had access to the pool and hot tubs. They did not confirm nor denied if the pools were open. The weather is not warm enough to go swimming. Seek a hotel with an indoor pool.",0
914,arenee42087,Jan 2021,I was there last weekend and the pool is closed. Although the room has a spa tub so my daughter was able to play in there and she loved it!,0

914,MARY K,Jan 2021,Luxor's pool is closed. They say you can go to Mandalay Bay but it's a very long walk. There is nothing for kids to do at the Luxor.,-1
915,NatalieGutierrez87,Jan 2021,Luxor is only using tower rooms right now due to the pandemic. Even if you book pyramid they will move you to tower at no additional fee.,1

920,Krynn L,Dec 2020,I think the entire hotel is smoke free but our room smelled like weed,0
921,djamesbabcock,Dec 2020,Because its a 1050 sqft room with 2 guests and the 2nd bedroom is a joining room. Should be a 4 person so guessing its a typo,0
922,sdrobbins612,Dec 2020,"I think they only may accept a credit card just in case you go above your incidentals availability. However, you may always call the Luxor reservations line and ask one of the agents. They‚Äôre always very friendly and incredibly helpful with all questions.",0
923,tonyca626,Dec 2020,"There were only two hotel employees helping guess check in. As the line grew, the employees continued to take their time.

924,JorgFam,Dec 2020,Main large pool was closed when we were there early November. Smaller pool was guests only no charge.,0

925,Timeseeker,Nov 2020,"I guess it would be the Tender Steakhouse. Didn't eat there. Ate at Diablo's Cantina once. Was ok, but nothing to write home about. Tender Steakhouse looked nice if you are willing to spend a lot-LOT of bucks on a name. Vegas is famous for that! Good luck.",0
926,AftonAmy,Nov 2020,I stayed in a Staywell Suite at Luxor when I was there on 10/29/20. The room was very clean and the common areas were reasonably clean as well. Part of the pool was open but there was almost no one there so I'm guessing that it was chilly.,1

If you are lower in the Pyramid the sitting room is a bit larger. Usually a couch and a chair. Two tvs in the room. In Sept stayed in a Pyramid Premier Suite. WOW. It is very large separate bedroom with door. Extra 1/2 bathroom.",1
928,Younglp2020,Oct 2020,We had a king suite in the tower and it was very nice. Two separate rooms ( living room/bar area and a very spacious bedroom) Beautiful view of the strip.,1

Plenty of cleaning taking place and many hand sanitiser stations around. In all fairness they were doing what was required and i felt safe. Take acre,1
932,ashvocals,Aug 2020,"I was there the day they initially shut down in March. No tests/checks then. Also, never received back the room holding fee that is supposed to be returned upon check out... So I wouldn't trust this hotel to do what they're supposed to.",0

934,tyrell675,Aug 2020,The 2 bedroom suites are in the tower as opposed to the Pyramid. The design of the tower partial strip / Excalibur or pool views. Firstly any room over 14 floors will give a good view. The main thing is this hotel is running at 58% capacity. I suggest upon arrival just politely ask for a the highest room available with a nice view. I have had strip views many a times but now just like to see the pool or mountains. I hope you have a great stay and take care.,0
935,timintunisia,Aug 2020,Yes there is a resort fee but if you sign up to the MLife card and use it every time you gamble you can earn rewards that can be set against the fee.,0
935,Sergio S,Aug 2020,"Yes, the hotel has resort fees, and as of now, parking is free. However, you would have to self park in the back, as they are not currently doing Vallet. If you have bag you want checked in, you will have to pull up to the front, unload your bags with a hotel staff and then drive to the back and park. You then have walk from the back parking and check in. After that you go to ur room and call front desk to have your bags brought up",0
935,Daniel I,Aug 2020,"Yes. All Hotels on the Vegas Strip has resort fees unfortunately... Gone are the days when there were no resort fees. In regards to Parking fees, I do not know the answer to that inquiry because I never drove while I was in Las Vegas. Hope this info helps!",0
935,derrickwg36,Aug 2020,"There is a resort fee, but currently the parking is free.",0

936,Keith M,Jul 2020,Sorry I have never stayed at Flamingo.,0
936,ron r,Jul 2020,I stayed in the Luxor. A simple call to the desk of the Flamingo would answer that question.,0
937,tyrell675,Aug 2020,"Ok , so hand sanitizer is around all areas in abundance. I also noted cleaning staff cleaning the slots very regularly. My wife and I had our own wet wipes which we also wiped over the slots prior to sitting down. As for face masks, casinos were offering to customers upon entry but overall people were wearing their own. You cant enter a casino without 1. I suggest taking a couple of your own and wash out daily. I found the whole area safe.",0
938,ron r,Jul 2020,I was there in early Oct a few years ago and it was. I would call the concierge and ask.,0
938,Kathy S,Jul 2020,I was there in February this year and it was open... so I think it most likely will be.,0

938,Keith M,Jul 2020,Sorry but We were not at the pool/spa so it's above my knowledge at this time...Great hotel however!!!,0
938,Vic777_12,Jul 2020,The pool is open as weather permits. October is still fairly warm in Vegas so it should be open. I believe the spa has a hot tub.,0
939,Alaskan,Jul 2020,"As long as you are in one of the premium rooms you should be alright so don‚Äôt change that. Make sure you find out how to self check in at one of the several kiosks they have on the casino floor (like when you are in an airport) so you won‚Äòt have to stand in line for an hour waiting to check in at the front desk. That is what happened to us and it was a real time consumer. That is very important to remember, so if you have to, call the casino and find out exactly what you have to do in order to self check in at a kiosk once you get there.",1
940,tyrell675,Jul 2020,"There are many reviews of the buffet good and bad. All I can say is, I go to LV every year and for the past 16 years have always ate at the Luxor buffet. Its a good clean solid buffet with many dishes and there is no doubt you will certainly find something to suit your tastes. Food was always hot and many many different dishes and the price range compared to some is good. Ate both a breakfast and dinner buffet here. Would def recommend it. Its more comfortable in a booth , just ask for one and the staff will accommodate. Take care",0
940,DJK,Jul 2020,So due to this pandemic the buffet won't be open. There are plenty of other restaurants that are fabulous near by,0
940,bensup,Jul 2020,No. In our opinion it was not. There are far nicer buffets at other hotels.,0

I will admit that I‚Äôve only stayed at the basic rooms in the pyramid; ie not in the new tower. Since I eat well in Las Vegas, I‚Äôve never had a need for a refrigerator. There are ice machines on each floor. There are ice buckets in each room. So if you‚Äôre only need to refrigerate beer or soft drinks, you don‚Äôt need refrigerator. If a refrigerator is important to you call the Luxor at its 800 number or send an email and ask if there are any rooms in your price category with refrigerators.",1

Sorry but I don't ever stay on the strip so I cannot offer any info on the Flamingo. The Golden Nugget offers good variety of rooms depending on how much money you want to spend. They have rooms to fit everyone's budget. I like the Gold Tower rooms because it meets my criteria in a room plus the Gold Tower is super close to the casino and restaurants.. The Rush Tower is the newest Tower and has very pretty up to date rooms. Spend some time on the web site and look at each room and see what each room has so you can choose a room to meet your needs. I have been staying at the Nugget for 42 years and won't stay anywhere else.",2
1048,587roberte,Jan 2020,"For a better price, accommodations & etc., would recommend doing further research at other hotel & casinos. Until the new places on Fremont Street are completed, I would recommend a place on the strip. MGM has many associated hotel/casinos that are more modern with a larger price range to choose from.",1
1048,vicki b,Jan 2020,"First, Congratulations!!!! I really like the Gold Tower. It can be a bit confusing when selecting a room. There are 3 towers. The Gold Tower is closest to the casino and restaurants. The Gold Tower has many selections on room types just like the other two towers. Just depends on what type of room you want.. The Carson Tower was the second\d tower built and is farthest from the casino. The Rush Tower is the newest tower. I love the Gold Tower and yes the rooms are modern, the gold tower deluxe has a very nice leather sectional, comfy bed, contemporary design which I love. Again, congratulations and enjoy your stay. Restaurants are great too! I especially like the Chart House. You can dine with the fishes which is so relaxing!!!",0
1048,JadeG,Jan 2020,"Thanks for your responses. I have booked The Golden Nugget for mid April. Reason for the trip is me and my partner are getting married there so that is the main reason but obviously we will be doing some sightseeing as well. After reading various reviews the room situation really confused me. I booked the Golden tower deluxe room, would you say these are modern rooms? Thanks again!",0
1049,Courtney C.,Jan 2020,You cannot. Vapes are also not allowed in the pool area.,0
1049,katiebrett,Jan 2020,As far as I know you can only smoke weed in open areas outside. You cannot in the pool area or I don‚Äôt believe in the hotel itself but you can smell it all the time so I am sure people do it anyway in their room. You can freely smoke on the streets. A really nice cannabis shop not to far away called nu wu. We took a lift one time and walked it another but def walk during day. It is still a couple miles away so Lyft might be better and not that expensive. They have vape pens (less stinky) and a lot of edibles and everything else you can think of. Pretty big place,1
1049,Cassandra O,Apr 2022,"Smoking marijuana in any area, other than your residence or home is a misdemeanor in Las Vegas. It is not allowed on the streets or any common areas.

1068,Ghamby2016,Jun 2019,"Cheryl A, Yes. This is true. With the demand for smoking rooms becoming less & less, the daily $50 fee ensures that you are indeed reserved in one of our increasingly limited smoking rooms. This also helps our staff take the necessary measures to neutralize any smoke odor inside the room upon guest checkout in the case the next guest happens to be a non-smoker. Currently, if a guest decides to smoke in a non-smoking room there is a $200 fine assessed to their bill. The last thing we would want to do is discriminate against ‚Äòsmokers‚Äô in any way, however, management has decided to enforce this policy to protect both sides.",1

Overall refined look to the tower, even though it is a little smaller than the other main section. Less traffic of other patrons.

1084,Foolinga,Mar 2019,"I went in January we stayed in the Carson tower it's way on the other end far away from everything. we're going again in September and we have booked in the gold tower, close to the casino floor the restaurants as well as the shark tank and pool..for a smoking room, needs to be requested and cost more per night so you shouldn't have a problem..all the smoking rooms are on the same floor.I would say the Carson tower is definitely more outdated.. I couldnt answer on the shade, I went in the pool at 10:30 in the morning didn't really pay attention I know there was sun. at the gold nugget we had an awesome time its right there on Fremont Street I would never stay on the strip after being on Fremont Street now..have a blast!! I hope this helps.",1
1084,BoardingPass814210,Mar 2019,We've stayed many time in the Carson tower. We've never had a problem with our rooms in either tower. The Carson tower seems to be more family oriented in my opinion. I don't think the Rush tower offers two queen/double beds. You can only get a King bed. When we stay with our kids we always book the Carson tower and get connecting rooms. When we go as a grown up trip we book the Rush tower which is completely non-smoking. My Mother-in-law has stayed in the Gold tower in a smoking room. She said it was nice and had no complaints. The pool area is surrounded by tall buildings. There will be some shade at different areas of the pool during different times of the day. If you are going in the summer and are not used to the heat.... It gets very hot but the pool water is refreshing and the beverages are cold. Bring sunscreen and have a blast.,0
1085,Foolinga,Mar 2019,We booked our trips out of Montana into Las Vegas through allegiant airlines we get our round trip fare and our hotel stay for $250 per person total.

You don't have to ""hope"" to get chairs and you can come and go as you please. The attendants are ""ON"" for anything you need and you are more likely to stay and enjoy the whole day since you feel you have invested in it. Between the resting and really enjoying the pool, and the food/drink service, I say ""rent it."" It's best when couples can split the cost. Plan to get there early. Like the regular chairs, the best locations go to those who show up and tell the attendants what they want.",0

I did a Southwest package once and they usually have room types to choose from so that I knew ahead of my arrival what room type I would get.

Then I switched to the Gold Tower Parlor Suite and Gold Tower deluxe rooms which are closest to the casino and has the rooms that fit my needs. The Rush Tower is the newest tower and I haven't stayed in one of the rooms but reviews have been good. There are lots of options available to choose from.

1111,CaptainDan2018,Dec 2018,"About 15 years ago, Silverton had a full scale RV campground with perhaps 200 full hook-up parking spaces. They tore it all out. These days, there are still large flat parking lots where occasionally you see RVs and trailers that appear to be occupied , but of course, there are no hookups, no sewer dumps, no water, etc. Camping is not encouraged, but they don't seem to chase you away. Park far out. They did complain to me once that their cameras need to see all the cars and activity in the lots, So, I had to move my RV to the furthest row so it would not block view of cars behind it. BEST to park in the Cracker Barrel parking lot! THAT's where you generally see camping trailers and RVs with curtains drawn in the windows (camping). Now... if you just want to visit and gamble, or even spend a night in their hotel, you could park an RV or small travel trailer in any lot, just take two spaces if you can find them. I suggest parking in the back of the hotel (drive around the East end of the Bass Pro/Outdoor World shops to get there).

1140,Leilani,Apr 2022,"I was in Vegas the end of February (2022). I stayed at 4 different Hotels. TI was the last one. Out of all of them, including the so-called ""Swanky"" Paris Hotel - I can honestly say TI was THE BEST one. The Paris was a nightmare. It was all the things you listed as fears in your question... and Worse. TI was close and convenient to EVERYTHING. The Kiosk to check in didn't work that day so the line was LONG to check in (It took about 20 minutes - compared to TWO HOURS at The Paris), but there were some people in line behind me who said that was the first time they've ever had to stand in line and they said they stayed at TI every time they vacationed in Vegas - because they liked it the most. This was my first time staying there and I was very pleased. The Reception Desk staff were plentiful and friendly and fast - You can ask them when you check in to confirm that everything you reserved for your room is what you're getting. PARKING IS FREE too! All the other hotels I stayed at charged between $18-30 to just park. Ridiculous! It was the reason I decided to give TI a try because Hey, money is money and the parking fees were adding up! I can honestly tell you that the tub was bigger and nicer than the one at The Paris, and the room was clean, cozy, and easy to access compared to the others I stayed at. My friend and I saw several different shows. None were at TI. I do recommend that if you'd like to have a drink for your birthday, visit ""Senor Frogs"" (attached to the front of the TI hotel). It has a variety of drinks (non-alcoholic and straight up cocktails). It also has a fun, cute, lively but laid back vibe and the appetizers are just as delicious as the drinks. You can't make a bad choice even if you closed your eyes and pointed to something on the menu to order! We did go see ‚ÄúThunder Down Under‚Äù (I recommend getting tickets IN ADVANCE). I didn't really want to go but I was pleasantly surprised. It was fun to watch and the men did a great job of pulling off a tasteful performance. You can see my honest reviews of everything we did while we were in Vegas for 5 days by clicking on my profile. As far as what shows are at TI that week, you can check out their website under ""ENTERTAINMENT"". Hope that helps and I wish you a VERY HAPPY and STRESS-FREE 40th!!!",2
1141,L E,Mar 2022,"Treasure Island. Don't know if all their rooms have been renovated, but the one we had, overlooking the strip was great. Clean, spacious and no cigarette smoke smell whatsoever.",1
1141,Leilani,Apr 2022,"I have to agree with the other posts. I was in Vegas the end of February (2022). I stayed at 4 different hotels - and had never been to any of them before. My greatest disappointment was The Paris - smoke-filled hallways, rude security guards, non-existent Hotel Managers (never responded to me to resolve my complaints/issues - even when I stood at the Front Desk to wait to speak to one because the phone calls weren't working!), and TWO people checking in the ""regular guests"" and two checking in the VIP guests - which took TWO HOURS (I'm not exaggerating!), the tub was TINY AS F0ck(!) and they automatically charged my credit card for things I didn't even use/request - the list of problems with The Paris is LONG. Treasure Island was my favorite out of all of them and was the one we stayed in on the last night. There were at least a DOZEN staff checking in the ""regular"" guests at the Front Desk and even though the kiosks weren't working the day I arrived, I stood in a LONG line for only 20 minutes. Two people in line behind me said they stayed at TI on a regular basis (because they liked it the most) and have never had to stand in a line to check in before. The room was clean, cozy, and comfortable. I was thrilled because the others had been so... Not. It was also the most affordable for a Friday night compared to the others that were easily triple the price. I will NEVER stay at The Paris - even if I won a free night there! It caused so many problems it took FOUR DAYS to resolve my issues. I will say that TI's Parking Garage is FREE, but a bit sketchy. The ceiling is VERY LOW (a full-size pickup truck with big tires had INCHES of clearance to drive around) and the lighting is not so great. Nothing in the Garage is well-marked so make sure you look on the wall (at car windshield level) for the Floor Numbers so you can find your car when you return. And to find the Elevator(s) look for flashing red and blue lights (like police lights) on the ceiling and go in that direction to access the Elevator. The whole garage should be torn down and rebuilt because the layout is confusing too. If you can make it to the 5th Floor, there's always plenty of parking spaces and the ride in the Elevator isn't very long (a lot less time than it takes to drive in circles on the 3rd Floor to find an open spot LOL). To give you an idea of price, I booked the room on 2/1/22 for the end of February for a total of $219 which includes $39 Resort Fee and $26 Taxes for two Deluxe Queen beds - again, on a Friday night. TI was also close and convenient to Everything. I'd definitely recommend it from personal experience - and I'm rather picky. Tip: Caesar-owned properties have gone DOWNHILL over the last 20 years.",0

They no longer require the use of face masks in Las Vegas (2 weeks prior to my arrival they lifted the mandate) and I attended several live shows and they didn't require COVID testing/results. Many required a face mask but didn't enforce it. Feel free to enjoy yourself! It was a nice change from my visit there last November where they strictly enforced a 72-hour test requirement.",0
1143,Leilani,Mar 2022,"Not at Treasure Island. They have FREE parking but the CEILINGS ARE LOW! There was a pickup truck in front of us and the roof of the vehicle BARELY fit under the ""guide bars"" hanging down to prevent rooftops from scraping on the ceiling. I thought they were going to get out and let some air out of their tires because they were going so slow! You could probably find some parking at a nearby SMITH'S Grocery Store (they're everywhere in Vegas) and then either drive a small vehicle to Treasure Island Hotel (they usually have plenty of open spots on LEVEL 5 of the parking garage) or take an Uber.",0

1214,Aussie2424,Dec 2018,I didn‚Äôt encounter anything like that. However one staff member gave me the long direction way to the then temp breakfast place rather than a short cut. And one staff member- a security person- was ‚Äòdirect‚Äô in telling me where the lift was when she could have been a tad gentle...but maybe she had just dealt with some ‚Äòunruly‚Äô guests perhaps...still I enjoyed the hotel,0
1214,DorNT,Dec 2018,"We had no experiences with any rude or threatening staff members. Everyone we asked for information was very accommodating. And believe me, we were lost most of the time! Maybe someone there had a bad day or they were short staffed, which happens to all of us once in a while. I would give them another chance as the hotel was wonderful for the price and location.",0
1214,Raghu,Dec 2018,"didn't experience any rudeness with staff either. All whom I talked to were pleasant and smiling from janitors, security personeel, casino floor attendees, etc. Infact, people have been driving these employees crazy for example keeping babies and kids while playing slots, allowing kids to freely roam unattended everywhere",0
1214,Laurel P,Dec 2018,No experience like that with me either. We found all staff to be pleasant and helpful and we were there over the extremely busy Thanksgiving Holiday.,0

1217,Jacki F,Dec 2018,I was there in June so didn‚Äôt use heat but they are very accommodating so I‚Äôm sure extra blankets wouldn‚Äôt be a problem to get,1

1225,Jodi M,Sep 2018,No coffee pot in room. But here‚Äôs a tip: cheapest coffee is in the gift shop at the top of the escalator toward parking garage. They don‚Äôt advertise it likley because Starbucks is at the bottom of the escalator.,2
1225,SouthTexasBrit,Sep 2018,"No, and no cups, paper or otherwise. If you have a need for the midnight cuppa, suggest you invest in an emersion heater (less than $10 at Walgreens or on Amazon). Too many USA hotels do not provide what is pretty much standard elsewhere - and the more expensive the room the less likely you'll have a coffee maker!",0
1225,danny c,Sep 2018,No they didn't in our rooms,0
1225,BWMORRISON,Sep 2018,Unfortunately there are no kettle coffee pots in the rooms. Still our favorite place to stay while visiting Vegas.,0

1225,Hitcher84,Sep 2018,No kettles or coffee in the room we had.,0
1225,Janet R,Sep 2018,"No, there is not even a coffee maker in the room. This is probably due to the fact that there are so many restaurants and shops on the resort that they want you to spend your dollars there.",0
1225,danov2018,Sep 2018,No we did t have a coffee pot in our room. We had a suite because we were upgraded and thought it was strange not to have one.,0

1227,dennispN9498XZ,Sep 2018,The above answers are about what you would expect. Not hot enough for going to the pool,1
1227,weinsteinc1959,Aug 2018,i can try early dec is a great time weather usually in the 70.s like that.i would pack a sweat shirt or a light leather jacket for evening but should be pretty comfortable then nights are around 60 or so .enjoy your trip and good luck you should have a great time,1

1229,dennispN9498XZ,Sep 2018,The views are great on any side of the hotel. if you are not on the strip or pool side you get a nice view of the city and mountains.,0
1229,stephenfL384WT,Aug 2018,"Most of the rooms don't have great views. If you want a view you will have to pay more for the view in most hotels. Yin/Yang, do you want a cheaper room or a view?",0
1229,Ginger W,Aug 2018,"We had an absolutely gorgeous view of the Venetian, the Palazzo, and the Wynn. My mom had a side room that overlooked the pool. Both were spectacular.",0
1230,stephenfL384WT,Aug 2018,"Resort fees are not generally refundable as they are really the hidden fee allowing more profit for the hotel/resort. That being said, if you have a legitimate complaint, I have negotiated a day off of my fee. Key is to complain (and take it to a manager) if you have a real problem. No air conditioning, hot water, etc. I've actually gotten the room free on one occasion.",1
1230,Jacki F,Aug 2018,We paid the resort fee for each day and it was not refunded.,1
1230,1962sherryp,Aug 2018,"Hello, I remember them charging us a resort fee and it is not refundable.",1
1230,AndrewCYorkshire,Aug 2018,I don‚Äôt think so but I‚Äôm sure the hotel would be able to confirm one way or the other,1
1230,dennispN9498XZ,Sep 2018,No refund.,0
1231,Spring84,Mar 2019,"Yes, you can eat at the restaurants of the hotels even if you are not staying there. With regards for reservations, some of them might need to make one especially the expensive restaurants. You just have to contact them in advance to make sure.",0
1231,dennispN9498XZ,Sep 2018,"You can eat at any of the restaurants and there are many good ones. Its best if you reserve, but they are usually not as busy during the week as they are on the week-ends.",0
1231,stephenfL384WT,Aug 2018,"No problem eating at any restaurant. They take everyone's $! If you go to a high class restaurant, I'd certainly suggest reservations. It does depend on what time you go and if Vegas is busy. Five PM isn't tough to get a table but 7:30 is. Wednesday isn't as tough as Saturday night, as you might expect.",0
1231,copperstatesatellite,Aug 2018,"You can eat at any restaurant at any hotel you would like, I do recommend making reservations at the higher end 5 star restaurants.",0
1231,Jacki F,Aug 2018,We ate at many different restaurants on the strip. We never made reservations. Hotel had pretty good restaurants,0
1231,BunBre,Aug 2018,"Yes! You have access to restaurants, casinos & bars at other resorts. Most places will not require a reservation unless you are in a large group or it's fine dining.",0
1231,Mike_48128,Aug 2018,"I am not sure what your question is about. With the possible exception of some intentionally overpriced restaurants at some casino-hotels, you can eat almost anywhere you please. Only the very ""fancy"" places require ""dinner or business"" attire. The rest of the places only require ""golf-course"" attire which includes such things as men's quality shorts and sport shirts. No swim suits or celebrity skimpy dresses, for the most part. At buffets we have seen people wearing almost anything including pajamas! It is always possible to ""charge"" food, supplies, and shows in your ""home"" hotel using the room ""key"" card, and perhaps other places as well. In general, your ""room"" key only works this way where you stay. Ask a casino ""host"" for further details. To ask is free. Certain rules will vary. Remember to bring a charge card. It is pretty-much required as a (temporary) security deposit at your hotel.",0
1231,Mike J,Aug 2018,"You can eat anywhere you like, this is not an all inclusive.",0
1231,Boltmom,Aug 2018,"Yes - you can eat anywhere on the Strip. We didn't reserve anywhere, but you may need to in the evening at some of the high-end celebrity chef restaurants. We had lunch at Gordon Ramsay's burger and just walked in - waited maybe 15 minutes in line.",0
1231,S_Robbie014,Aug 2018,You may eat at other hotel restaurants and many do take reservations.,0
1231,Jan C,Aug 2018,"Restaurants are not restricted to guests only. Most use apps such as TripAdvisor, Open Table or Yelp. Best meal we had was at Buddy V‚Äôs. If you love Italian, it is a must. Reservations were easily made thru the TripAdvisor app.",0
1231,Donna E,Aug 2018,There are plenty of restaurants to choose from and you will be able to dine in any of them. It is always recommended for the restaurants that take reservations (like Guy Fiere or Gordon Ramsey restaurants) you will want to make reservations well in advance. There are some places that do not accept reservations and plenty of buffets to choose from as well in which you can wait to be seated. Just depends what you're looking for and the time of day.,0
1232,dennispN9498XZ,Sep 2018,Most deluxe rooms except for handicap I think do.,0

1236,SouthTexasBrit,Jul 2018,Just an additional option.,1
1236,KakalinaW,Jul 2018,"They will not fully replace the front desk service. Like at an airline check-in, you will be able to self check in for speed, or wait for a representative. Enjoy your travels, my son loved Belgium when he visited.",1
1236,copperstatesatellite,Jul 2018,"I Have not used the automated check in at TI yet, but did use it at Bally's and ended up having to wait in a very long line because it did not validate both rooms for both nights, very frustrating",0

1238,Natalie K,Jun 2018,Yes it is true. Not sure when or if it‚Äôll reopen,2
1238,Christopher P,Jun 2018,"I would call TI (phone number on internet) to confirm that the restart date is really going to be October. My experience with projects such as this is that they take longer than expected to complete. The walk between the Mirage and TI is not too arduous and despite my bum knee, I was able to do it every day since it was mostly level. The stairs between the TI lobby and the TI tram station were rougher in my opinion (the escalator going up was out when we were last there).",1

1244,Linda S,Jun 2021,"I was there in December and the toiletries were high end and excellent; however, there was no brand name on them but rather each has Wynn on bottle. They obviously purchase them from a dedicated vendor and have their name placed on bottle. I really liked the soap and hairspray....all with delightful fragrance that indicates high end not cheap.",0

1245,Linda S,Jun 2021,"As a resident of Las Vegas I can play there without being a hotel guest; so I'm not sure of that; however, the cost to play is $500/round per person. It's a beautiful golf course and worth the money.",0

1246,RK Zachary,May 2021,"I believe you were asking about whether the tower suites would be suitable for a family with children. I think they would, but understand that only one of the pools that is for the suites is available for children. We did see kids swimming there and it looked very nice. The pools downstairs are available for children also.",0
1247,Linda S,Jun 2021,"Don't think a 5-year old would find much to do.....to me it's more of an high-end adult resort With a child I would suggest Excalibur, New York New York with fun rides, arcades, etc.",0

1248,Linda S,Jun 2021,"Both resorts sit next to each other and are owned by the Wynn Corporation. The decor and colors are different however the rooms, public places, etc are both excellently maintained and 5-star high-end. You wouldn't be disappointed in either one and they are connected so you can easily move from one hotel to the other and experience the many restaurants and shops.",0
1248,719cromero,May 2021,The difference is only in accommodations and decorations! The quality is the same! Sorry my delay to answer,0
1249,texastraveler,Apr 2021,Don't go. Wait until the state reopens. It's no fun and impossible to find food unless you have reservations everywhere,1
1249,rboyles0000,Apr 2021,"OK, but we have it scheduled for early June, and I heard that it will open up after June 1st? (could always change, but...).",0
1250,SomeGrrrl,Apr 2021,I personally have never seen the Wynn pool at capacity (even during covid) so I really don't think a daybed or cabana would be necessary. They have always had plenty of chairs available when I have gone.,0
1251,Travelcat214,Apr 2021,"Hello, I‚Äôm not sure about the length of the bathtub as I did not measure it, however it is quite large. Regarding the complementary coffee and tea in the morning: when I was there in Aug./Sept. 2020, that was not an option.

1252,719cromero,Mar 2021,Yes but in marked areas! Have too room reservations for people who smoke!,0

1257,CFM,Feb 2021,You don't stay in your room much in Las Vegas.,0
1258,sharonsG5145SX,Jan 2021,I would say Cipriani.,1
1258,Craig B,Jan 2021,Lots of great restaurants but i would have to say Wing Lei which is michelin star Cantonese Restaurant. Others would probably say SW Steakhouse which is top notch American style steakhouse. On the Encore side it would be Sinatras which is fabulous old school Italian,0
1259,cannonater,Dec 2020,Yes...Depending on if you‚Äôre flying or not.. Uber from airport or free covered parking are your best option,1
1259,bill B,Dec 2020,I do not believe any of the hotels in LV currently have Valet I prefer Bellagio self parking. it's easy and less walkng than the Wynns. also staff at wynn has an attitude. like your lucky to be at the hotel.,1
1259,Lupe G,Mar 2021,Sorry for the late response but at the time in Nov 2020. Their was No Valet Parking.,0

1260,Lupe G,Mar 2021,I was told No More Buffetüò¢,0
1260,Travel Lifeüíï,Nov 2020,Probably not until pandemic is over! They were extremely strict about masks and seating only small groups of 6 or less. Nevada Governor has much more strict mandates than other states,0
1261,Shasta D,Oct 2020,The Wynn did not treat us very good. We choose our eating and entertainment at other resorts. I would not spend another dime there. I literally walked to another resort for everything but sleeping.,0

1261,GrandTour545523,Oct 2020,"No, no Buffet for the foreseeable future, I did miss that",0
1261,Atlpen,Oct 2020,Buffet is closed until further notice. Wynn tried to reopen with a changed more safe format and it was rejected by customers so they closed it down.,0
1261,Michelle W,Oct 2020,As of 2 weeks ago no. None of the buffers were open.,0

1294,brad j,Oct 2019,"A few thoughts on the recent questions: first, in general, you can get very good info on a timely basis by writing to the concierge on the wynn website; the room upgrade usually in ""view"" meaning floor to ceiling windows, golf course etc. If you have a choice get golf course view; beautiful and quiet; even though i had a very high room, music from the pool travels up the windows and can be heard in high rooms; ask for a room away from pool; the echo in the room looks state of the art so i would assume you can do whatever you want; as to check in, usually you can get a key which gives you pool access and then a text when room ready; what i have started to do and think it is worthwhile is to spend the $50 and get guaraneteed early check in by 11 am; as to the 9pm flight, i always call the hotel, wheather the wynn or a marriott or whatever and let them know in order to avoid a mistake by a human who cancels my room or because i have not read some fine print update which says that unless i call i lose it; be safe and call. Call reservations about the gym; I don't think wynn is part of any Frequent travel program, including AAA. The only way to get room discounts (beside gambling) is to join the red card club and get the emails all year; there are often some very good deals",1

1299,CarnivoresandVegans,Aug 2019,"The Wynn is a favorite hotel for many, not only due to the beauty, on point service, and amenities, but that it is a great hotel for adults and business travelers. That is not to say that there are not families there, there are plenty. However, children running around and cannon balling into the pool can absolutely kill the chill of an adult oriented ambiance. It is their right as guests absolutely, so what can one say? - The side of the strip that houses Wynn and Encore also has neighbors such as the Trump hotel, again more adult and business oriented. - Families, particularly ones with you kids may feel just a bit more at home going the other direction, as you walk that way you will see more young ones having fun! The Venetian is the smallest of walks across the road and is beautiful 5 star property with free parking, self and valet. It is family centric for sure, the gonodalas and water and ""sky"" inside are lovely, soooo many places to eat and shop for families. You see a few more families at the Bellagio than the Wynn, but the Bellagio, Caesars, and the Cosmo have a lot of adult ""Nightlife"" and tend to get a lot adult travelers ready to party. Families are still welcome, but you may get a lot more night noise from revelers. If you are not explicitly looking for a 5 star, MGM cannot be any more centrally located and houses a 50/50 mix of just about every lifestyle (MGM also has direct monorail access, you will not get this at the Wynn, the Linq is the closest access), and Polo Towers next door is family hotel with kids outdoor areas and full kitchens complete with supplies: ie dishes, pizza slicer; etc. Further down is New York, Excalibur, Tropicana, Flamingo, these hotels are not run down perse, but a far cry in quality if you were originally looking for a 5 star property. Good luck and I hope you and your family have a great trip where ever you all stay!",1

1310,Ron D,May 2019,"We booked through travel agent,, sorry",0
1310,Barbara R,May 2019,"Hi Jillian, I'm not sure which code you are talking about but you can find out by going to the website, pretend to make a normal booking without any codes and take a note of that price. Then go back in there and pretend to make a booking with the passcode to see the difference. While I have not tried ringing Wynn and then giving the passcode, I have done this with other hotels but I always made sure I knew what I would have paid without the passcode for that same period. If you know that, then you can figure out whether the deal is good. Sometimes, you may find a hotel will really only give you a rate where the total might only be $20 difference and they will say (not necessarily Wynn) that the rate online is not the rate they are discounting. Nevertheless, try and see. Sometimes, depending on how far in advance you look, you may actually get a better deal closer to that timeframe. For example, booking now for say, October, may not be good as the prices drop. However, as long as you can receive a refund, then you can re-book when the rate is better. Hope this wasn't too much info. Cheers",0
1311,Tonia P,May 2019,"Wynn and Encore operate together and the Encore Beach Club is where you can buy access and it's a bit ""crazy"" (think lots of drunk people in tiny bathing suits). I would recommend you book a room in the Tower Suites so you can have access to the Tower Suite pools (you aren't allowed in otherwise) in addition to the other benefits that go with being a Tower Suite guest (breakfast options). They are less crowded and crazy if you want a break from crowds and noise. As far as other recommendations, make sure you catch the ""show"" at the pool of Dreams (look for the Parasol Down bar and go outside) - it's freaky and cool (and free). Also make some time to go by the Bellagio at night to watch the Dancing Fountains for a bit. They're beautiful! A great evening is to have dinner at Mon Ami Gabi (a steakhouse) in hotel Paris right across the street from the fountains and then walk over after dinner to watch them for a bit. Bellagio is also a beautiful hotel (my second favorite) and has great restaurants and clubs as well that aren't as pricey as others. Lastly, best club in all of Vegas in my opinion is Omnia for pure visual impact. It's not cheap but you can get tix in advance through their website with a prepaid drink card to skip the line at the door. The main dance floor is incredible with the lights and moving chandelier (you feel like aliens are going to abduct you) and girls dropping down on trapeze swings to deliver bottles of bubbly. If you need a break from the noise you can go to their outdoor rooftop patio and see a beautiful view of the strip! Have fun!!",1
1311,Scott N,May 2019,"You‚Äôre going to love it! It‚Äôs a classy hotel with a great vibe. The daytime pools are free. I‚Äôve never been at night with dis but that‚Äôs not my thing. Here are some suggestions..... the golden tiki or Franks tiki bar is a must, go to stratosphere and go up to the top for free by going to the restaurant bar and having a drink. They have 2 for 1 happy hour. Definitely go to Fremont street. If you want to do something really different go downtown and go to a shop called retro Vegas , they have awesome things that are from the 70‚Äôs. The peppermill is cool right after the encore it‚Äôs half Lounge and 1/2 cafe, the lounge side is awesome with sunken in fire pits. They filmed some of the movie casino there . And one of my favorite things I‚Äôve done multiple times a called the neon museum. You have to make a reservation and it‚Äôs a must do at night not in the day Bc you take a tour and get to see old hotel signs and other neon signs that used to light up Vegas, it‚Äôs awesome trust me. Also, by a 24 hour pass to ride the monorail , it goes from westgate all the way to I think the Excalibur.... and also you can do the eye at the linq it‚Äôs pricey but worth it at least once and they have certain cars that have a bar in it and it‚Äôs as much as you want to drink until you make one full circle. Hopes this helps have a great time. Also Caesars buffet is my favorite but gets crowded also the Wynn buffet. And go through the bellagio and go look at the arboretum I think it‚Äôs called, it‚Äôs always themed and made with 100‚Äôs of flowers ....",1

I know your implying it was my fault for leaving my door and safe open. You can stop. You probably work for hooters cuz they said the same thing. This was an inside job. Had to have been. And they've been covering up every incident. I've talked to some of the others this has happened too. Biiiig inside job. They probably only target certain rooms that are near the stairs too.,1

No, they do not give a discount for those guests who stay at their facility.

We don't have a happy hour, however, each day we will be offering specials. Hope to see you soon!",0
1398,HCHLV,May 2017,"Thank you for your question. While our rooms do not have refrigerators in them, we can provide one upon request. We suggest you contact us directly to make arrangements.",0
1399,HCHLV,May 2017,"Thank you for your question. Yes, we do offer smoking rooms, however, they are not a guarantee. We will do our best to provide you with a smoking room if requested based on availability.",0
1400,HCHLV,May 2017,"Thank you for your question. Our resort fee, while noted on the site, is not included in what you were charged. We collect our resort fee upon check-out.",1
1400,israel G,May 2017,There's a $29 daily Resort fee. Which to be honest it's a complete rip-off. The only thing you get out of this hotel I will say is Wi-Fi.,-1
1401,HCHLV,May 2017,"Thank you for your question. Our city view rooms provide views of the south end of the Las Vegas strip. Due to the size of some of the other hotels, you will not be able to see the entire strip, but you will still have a great view of the hotels near our location.",1
1402,HCHLV,May 2017,"Thanks for your question. All of our rooms have been renovated. Yes, you can request a bottom floor room, however, it is not a guarantee. We do our very best to honor such requests, but sometimes, due to business levels and already checked in rooms, this is not always possible. We will make every effort to get you the room that you are preferring.",0
1402,Heather_lynn111,May 2017,"Thank you for the speedy response. One more question, are their fridges available? We need a fridge for medication. If so, what is the price for that. Thanks!",0
1403,HCHLV,May 2017,"Thank you for your question. We are currently renovating the interiors of our elevators. While this is occurring, we do require an elevator for each tower to be out of service. We are working hard to complete this work with minimal disruption to our guests. We thank you for your patience.",0
1403,bbachtelle,May 2017,"We stayed there the third week of April, and all were working. Construction in the lobby area complete. All was fine!",0
1403,Anibal P,May 2017,I was at the Hooters' hotel late March and all the elevators were working good,0
1403,Shaina H,May 2017,"We were there two weeks ago and only one was working and on our last day neither one of them were working, we had to take stairs to floor two and use the elevator there to get to the ground floor.",0
1404,miryg012,May 2017,The days I was there Friday through Sunday (4/21-23) they were not working. I never even saw an attempt to try and fix them. Hope this helps. It was on one of the towers,0
1405,HCHLV,Apr 2017,"Thanks for your question. If you are booking through our website, we do show you the total for the room, the total for taxes and fees (this amount includes all taxes and resort fee charges), as well as a grand total of what you will pay. On third party websites, the resort fee is not shown in their total, as we (the hotel) collect the resort fee and tax on that upon check-out. Unfortunately, we do not accept credit card authorizations from an individual that is not checking into the hotel, as our policy requires the reservation to match the credit card and ID presented at check-in. We apologize for the inconvenience.",0
1405,James C,Apr 2017,Answer to your first question is yes. I'm not sure about your second question,0
1406,HCHLV,Apr 2017,"Thank you for your question. We apologize, but pets are not allowed.",0
1407,HCHLV,Apr 2017,"Thank you for your question. We have been in private contact with you regarding this and look forward to having you come to stay with us soon. Resort fees do vary from hotel to hotel and we have one of the lowest in town. While we have been under construction, there was a short period of time that our fitness center was closed due to improvements. This was the only time that a resort fee amenity was not available and we worked hard to finish that area with minimal impact to our guests. All other items included in our resort fee were never not provided. Thanks again for your question and we hope to see you soon.",1
1407,Bob J,Apr 2017,"To the best of my knowledge resort fees are not regulated by law. Other respondents have explained them pretty well, I think.",1
1407,Jason K,Apr 2017,"Vegas resort fees are simply a SNEAKY way for hotels to advertise lower rates online. Nearly every hotel/casino on the strip & Freemont charge resort fees now and are somewhere in the $20 - $45 range per night. You can ask to have them reduced or removed, but unless you are a high roller or have some issues with your room/stay, they are unlikely to do anything it. Resort fees are determined by each hotel, not the state. In my opinion, the government need to step up and stop these misleading advertising practices. Since the hotels make these fees mandatory, they should be shown when searching rates online.",1
1407,Van C,Apr 2017,"The resort fee covers other things like internet, newspaper, bottled water and use of pool, gym or parking in many cases. Since most of the pools in Las Vegas are not opened during winter months, then in my personal view the resort is not in full function. However, most hotels including Hooters does not pro-rate it for amenities that are currently not being offered due to season. Resort fees do vary from hotels to hotels. I don't believe it is a State tax. I've stayed at Monte Carlo during the summer months when all amenities are available and resort fee is same as winter when some amenities are not available. I've stayed at Flamingo too as it has been renovated, they did not charge resort fees then but do check as hotels do try to make revenue on everything these days. Hooters did not charge for parking in their parking lot for guests.",1
1408,HCHLV,Mar 2017,"Yes. All of our guest rooms (in both towers) have been renovated. We are currently renovating the casino floor and expect that to be finished very soon. Some of the things coming are new and exciting food and beverage offerings, new carpet on the casino floor, new pit area, a new sports book and bar (which is partially done and open)...just to name a few. Also, we have a brand new gift shop and front desk area.",0
1409,HCHLV,Mar 2017,Thank you for your question. Only the rooms located in our Bay View tower (the smaller of our 2 towers) have rooms that have a sliding glass door that allows access to the balcony. All rooms in this tower have balcony access.,0
1410,HCHLV,Mar 2017,"Thank you for your question. Unfortunately, we do not have a poker room. We are currently undergoing renovations on our casino floor (and not all tables are open), however, after renovations are complete (very soon), we will have the following table games available: (15) BJ Tables - $1 to $25 (2) Roulette (2) Pai Gow (1) 3-Card Poker (1) Craps Table To answer your question on comps: Comps are not based on buy in or loss. Comps are based on time played x average bet. Hope this helps and we look forward to seeing you soon!",1
1410,witty38,Mar 2017,"I saw 5 active table games. I saw roulette, 3 card poker and Pai Gow. No daily poker tournaments.",1
1410,Roy A,Mar 2017,"No poker room, it has black jack,craps andd roulette",1
1410,Raymond S,Mar 2017,I don't gamble but my impression was of a small casino. Not too hectic.,0
1411,HCHLV,Mar 2017,"Thanks for your question. We are scheduled to complete all renovations by the end of April. While deadlines sometimes change, we are working hard to have completion of all areas by that time. You can always check with us again to make sure. Hope to see you soon!",0
1412,HCHLV,Mar 2017,"Thank you for your question. Yes, the grand total that you see online includes all room rates, daily resort fees and taxes. Room rates are shown separately per day and the line ""tax and fees"" is the amount of all taxes and resort fees that will be charged, in addition to the room rates. When reserving online, that grand total amount will be charged to your card upon booking. If you book on the phone with us, just the first night's room and tax is charged to your card. You will be required to pay any additional night's rates, all resort fees and all remaining taxes when you check out.",1
1412,amccaleb,Mar 2017,No they charge resort fee and deposit at check in,1
1412,Del M,Mar 2017,"When you check in they take a deposit of $50 per day in case of damages it's just a hold and your credit card doesn't get dinged, the resort fee is roughly $27 per night ,which is about average and they charge your credit card on departure",1
1412,Action Lummoxxx,Mar 2017,"It was added when I got there. $22, I think?",1
1412,Mark S,Mar 2017,I do not believe Hooter's has a resort fee. So the total is the actual total. No surprises. Enjoy your visit to Las Vegas!,1
1413,HCHLV,Mar 2017,"Hi, thanks for your question. Our standard rooms do not have refrigerators, however, we do have them available upon request.",0
1414,HCHLV,Feb 2017,"Thanks for your question. While we do not offer a shuttle from the airport, you can always hop in a cab or there are several airport shuttle services that make a stop at our hotel. For a minimal fee they will drop you off right at our location. You can also arrange round trip service. Check the airport website for more information. See you soon!",0
1414,Del M,Mar 2017,"Take a cab, it's quicker and for the 3 of you it will cost $16 plus a special fee of about $3 , I don't know what it covers but with tip we got to Hooters for$21 bucks",0
1415,HCHLV,Jan 2017,"Yes, we do have a fitness center. Our guests have access to this, along with other amenities, as part of our resort fee. See you soon!",0
1415,Diego M,Jan 2017,"Hi, the hotel does not have a gym.",0
1415,zuik3n .,Jan 2017,I never saw one but I also never asked if they did.,0
1415,ChipCache,Jan 2017,Not that I am aware of as I typically like to exercise over vacation as well,0
1415,nick w,Jan 2017,"hi, yes there is a gym , although it isn't as well equipped as most gyms are today",0
1416,HCHLV,Jan 2017,Yes! Our pool will be open...weather permitting of course!,1
1416,PlaytimewithMiss_T_e,Jan 2017,Yes it will be. It's a newly redone heated pool.,0
1417,HCHLV,Dec 2016,"Thank you for your question. We are currently in the last phase of our guest room renovations. We are striving to keep any construction noise to a minimum, and our timeline for completion is by the end of this year. After the first of January, we will begin renovations on our casino floor, with all construction being done in both of our guest room towers.",0
1417,robcatSteRoseMB,Jan 2017,it was a year ago and never noticed any noise inside,0
1417,donovan p,Dec 2016,In September they had one wing close down for construction. You almost couldn't tell that anything was going on. It was my understanding that after they finish that wing they will move to the other wing,0
1417,PlaytimewithMiss_T_e,Dec 2016,There wasn't construction going on and it was quiet in November,0
1417,Dagmar A,Dec 2016,While we were there in August there was no construction going on. I would give them a call.,0
1417,Margie T,Dec 2016,"I would agree this hotel needs to have construction. ...not nice at all. Casino is very basic. There is a Motel 6 right next door that might be a better choice. If you have a car, or plan on getting a rental, by all means stay elsewhere. If Hooters is more reasonable for price and Strip Proximity, and you just want to sleep, OK. I was there over Memorial and it was quiet.",0
1417,KarenandTim2010,Dec 2016,"No construction when we were there. Not sure construction is what they need....demolition, I think, is the only hope for this dump. So many choices in Las Vegas ....don't make this one of them.",0
1417,Dentldoc,Dec 2016,"There was construction when I was there about 6 months ago. From inside the hotel, you can hear no noise from the street.",0
1417,Heather W,Dec 2016,"I stayed there from August 30 thru September 6 before changing hotels. There wasn't construction going on when I went, but I continuously saw where Hooters replyed to reviews stating there are plans to start renovating the rooms. They had just finished renovating the pool area.",0
1418,HCHLV,Sep 2016,"Thank you for your question. Yes! The King, starring Trent Carlini is here at Hooters Casino Hotel. His show is at 7pm Wednesday through Monday in our Night Owl Showroom.

1420,Howard F,Jul 2016,No. Didn't open til 10 when I was there. Don't know when it closes,0
1420,Osvaldo C,Jul 2016,"Last time there,a couple of month ago, was under maintenance , but save yourself a bad time and choose something else. This place is bad and Vegas is plenty of afordable options.",0
1420,jason w,Jul 2016,I would not stay here. Seriously it was not good,0
1420,A Tripadvisor Member,Jul 2016,"Don't know, best to check with the hotel.",0

1420,diananimagoo,Jul 2016,I don't think so I think it is closed by 10PM,0
1421,HCHLV,Jul 2016,"Thanks for your question. Yes, you will still need to post a deposit of $25 per night. This is an authorization/hold (not a charge) to your card that is released, minus any charges, at check-out. Our resort fee is charged at check-out.",0
1421,Sanjay C,Jul 2016,Yes you would be . But it's refundable and they will deduct from your total outstanding at checkout .,0

1423,LavonneLee,May 2016,"It looked like they were almost ready to open, from our window it was just filled and they were finishing up! I would just call and ask. :)",0
1423,RafaelSB83,May 2016,When I was there in September 2015 it was open. If it's closed now then I would recommend calling the hotel and ask them.,0

1427,Kevin H,Apr 2016,"I only remember seeing slots,roulette, blackjack and craps. There is a Texas hold em sit down video game. They have $3 minimum blackjack. Very small place, MGM across the street is alot better.",0
1427,symbol41,Apr 2016,Ok - scratch my answer- looks like Freakarius knows it ;-),0
1427,symbol41,Apr 2016,"Hi Freakarius ;-) To be honest, I didn't play there so I don't know - It's only a small gambling area so I think you'd have more chance at some of the bigger casinos than at Hooters. Best from Mark",0
1427,Freakarius,Apr 2016,Yes and cheap!!,0
1428,Ahmet B,Apr 2016,"No, ƒ∞t does not, but very close to other hotels and they have.",0

1430,T W,Jan 2016,No. No laundry,0
1430,Jeff c,Jan 2016,1/2 mile to the west there is a laundry also has excellent slot machines in it,0
1430,Mishu818,Jan 2016,"Hi Georgia, they do not have a laundry service, but they are very close to a lot of mini type malls, that may have those services. Enjoy and do not worry about laundry, you can always buy something.",0
1430,leniki,Jan 2016,no they dont,0
1430,Bob J,Jan 2016,I don't know. Perhaps you call the hotel.,-1
1431,hotkamdog,Nov 2015,They are pretty accomodating and friendly so if they aren't booked up solid then there is a good chance they might let you in for free but i think the nominal charge anywhere is $20.00 to early check in. It certainly doesn't hurt to ask and after all they do want your business. Enjoy!! :),0
1431,Karina P,Nov 2015,Sorry I meant my early check in,0
1431,Karina P,Nov 2015,I didn't get my early check out even my room was available. I would have to pay $20 to get in!,0
1431,Terried529,Nov 2015,"You can ask, they are pretty accommodating. But if check out is 11am and they are 100% booked the night before, chances are they might not have a room ready until about noon.",0
1432,Terried529,Nov 2015,"normally hooters is 75% cheaper than MGM, call the rewards desk before you book.",0
1432,1virgochk,Sep 2015,"I used Groupon also to get a good rate at Hooters, but after staying I doubt I would stay again. I agree with everyone else. The Stratosphere is great I usually stay there and the Luxor was nice too, but I liked the pool at Stratosphere better.",0
1432,Vanessa M,Sep 2015,I always use Groupon to book there. Better rates and they give you free stuff to enjoy,0
1432,1987porsche944,Sep 2015,"I got an incredibly affordable rate last September, but I used one of the discount travel sites - I think it was Expedia. Trying checking there, and maybe places like Travelzoo/Kayak/etc. Some of the buying club groups (Groupon/Living Social/etc) have travel deals as well. Also, if you have Amex or similar credit cards, they may offer their own deals for members-only. I had a fine stay at Hooters when I went last year, it wasn't luxury, but I slept fine and it was clean. I wouldn't have wanted to pay too much. Good luck!",0
1432,Mishu818,Sep 2015,"The rates that I recieved the year before and this year was a combination airfare and hotel package that a usually start checking the price maybe 2 months ahead. The real cost comes the silly resort fees that most of the casinos charge. This year the resort fee was$140.00. I never book way ahead because you never know what happens in life. Also, some of the hotels are cheaper but then the resort fees are a lot higher so it sort of balances out. I want the convenience of Hooter's. Hope this helps a little, enjoy.",0
1432,RerunMC,Sep 2015,It's not worth it last time I stayed at Hooters it was a dump. The Stratosphere is way better for the price if you're looking for some where affordable. Just my 2 cents.,0
1432,n37077,Sep 2015,"Not sure what the question is but that is my experience too. I'm going to LV in November and the Hooters was twice the price of many of the reasonable hotels around it, so I'm staying in the Luxor.",0
1433,Denis M,Aug 2015,"WiFi yes, not to sure of the valet parking as I flew in and took a cab from the airport.",1
1433,Terried529,Nov 2015,"Valet is always there for what you tip, unless you stay at Wynn, or other high end then $15 or more. There is a lot of talk in Vegas about no more free parking anywhere. Downtown charges unless you are a guest.",0
1433,0824La01,Nov 2015,Yea there is a valet parking and the suck azz..they don't even have a valet area because there remodeling there parking area so be ready to have your car park outside.hooters sucks no wonder they have a :( on there reviews..and there rooms r full with roaches and there TV r from a century ago..there room service sucks,0

1435,Kevin T,May 2015,I think it was 4-6 with special prices on some appetizers and a dollar or two off drinks.,0
1435,Embrace_Life_Now,May 2015,"I'm not sure, we didn't notice a main bar anywhere and waitresses were hard to find on the gambling floor. At this time of year they have a tiny ba near the pool but I don't know if it participates in Happy Hour. Best to call the hotel.",0
1435,Karen R,May 2015,Good question. No I don't remember the times.,0
1435,BillySalts,May 2015,"Hello! Happy hour times? I'm not really sure. We got off the plane, unpacked and started drinking beers at the casino. Sorry I can't give you a better answer, we bought beers throughout the day and I wasn't thinking about happy hour times",-1

I guess it depends on the type of room you want but it‚Äôs the same hotel. Just be very there‚Äôs a little bit of construction going on in the front and there‚Äôs a lot more walking involved from where you get dropped off.

1452,Douglas A,Nov 2021,Usually pretty good! If they were at Allegiant Stadium or T Mobile Arena which are larger venues there would almost for sure be last minute deals.

Last time I was there I was there for the Millionaire Maker Tournament. 2 Days after we flew home they Shut Dow the Strip & we went into Covid 19 quarantine. We here in California are just starting to open back up however the Virus is still racking up the Cases as of Today. 6/9/2020. Bs Safe when Traveling,0
1522,Bob T,Jun 2020,"I would skip this Casino. They will take your reservation and then shift to a different resort they own without a care in the world. Terrible guest relations...they do not give a darn about their customers, honestly can't express enough how poorly we were treated Never again will I step a foot inside this resort or their other properties. Try The Venetian they care about their customers we have stayed there a dozen times and it has always been amazing.",0

1524,Andrew M,May 2020,"Not sure how the heck to answer this question, since I don't work for Caesars and am not privy to any knowledge about how they plan to go about their reopening. My semi-educated guess is that they will be extremely attentive to keeping things clean. I was there just a few days before the Strip was shutdown in mid-March, and Caesar's (and other properties on the Strip) were already going out of their way to disinfect everything and provide hand sanitizer dispensing machines in many parts of the property. I suspect that will be the case once Caesar's reopens. I'm also guessing that (sadly) the Caesar's buffet will be closed in the short to medium term. For the most part, I enjoyed my time staying at Caesar's, though I was somewhat disappointed with: 1) the housekeeping services and 2) the fact that water leaked from the shower to the ""private"" room with the toilet. Not sure if I'll stay in Caesar's again (probably not), but I'm confident that Caesar's (as well as the other properties on the Strip) will do an amazing job of keeping things clean and making people feel comfortable. I definitely look forward to going back to Las Vegas.",1

1539,cwgold,Jul 11,Hi. The pool area opened at 8 it did start to fill up 930ish. July 4 th wkend the lazy River was packed. No room between tubes at all. If they count? They counted too many in my opinion it should be quieter I would think for the rest of the month.,0

1545,tschramm0722,Apr 2022,Yes! Reserving a day bed or cabana is a good idea. Otherwise you‚Äôll need to get there at nine when the pool opens.,2

Also note, you have to buy tubes if you want to use the lazy river if you don‚Äôt have one. There‚Äôs no rental. Some of the reservation packages come with tubes. If not, bring one with you for a quarter of the price",0
1545,marygilberti,Apr 2022,Yes definitely. Always good to reserve ahead. Pool fills up very quickly,0
1545,Tammy W,Apr 2022,"Yes. I would definitely recommend making a reservation. As the temperature warms up in Las Vegas, more and more people will be hanging around he pool area. Afternoons and early evening are some of the busiest times, too.",0

I had trouble finding one seat at 11am when I went down by the lazy river but I found one at the other pools very easily. Later when my family came there were heaps of seats. The lazy river is filled with children so I preferred the other pools personally, being splashed and hit in the face didn‚Äôt appeal to me, so I didn‚Äôt mind not getting a lazy river spot.",0
1545,Frank V,Apr 2022,A reservation is always recommended anywhere you go. If you reserve in advance you may get better pricing.,0
1545,Matthew A,Apr 2022,"If your going in the summer time and you might be arriving late yes definitely, but note that the lounge chairs are first come first serve , the one you can reserve are the little beach huts , which are awesome but pricey. Enjoy you trip ! And have fun !",0
1545,shahad52022,Apr 2022,"Most definitely. The pool (lazy river) is packed. It‚Äôs worth the extra cash you will need to spend. Also, you should buy your inflatable tire floaty somewhere. The price at the pool side shop is super expensive.",0

You can bring in drinks and food from elsewhere, at least I saw people doing that, I didn‚Äôt personally. The lazy river is frantic with children, the other pools have mostly adults so it is nicer. I found seats easily and it was 30 Celsius when I was there so perfect weather. I just walked up, scanned my card and went in, no wait list nothing of the sort. I walked straight through basically, no wait at all. Would recommend the pool, it was great, hotel not so much but the pool was awesome!",0
1550,curtislamb1970,Mar 2022,"Water was 6$ a bottle when I was there in January and if it‚Äôs in room they bill 12$. Beat if bring your own bottled water. Also they have a snack try right next to the TV and lights, which makes it easy to touch especially if had some drinks. I don‚Äôt mean opened up or grabbed but just touched. They move very easily and if you don‚Äôt put back in the right spot within 5 seconds it charges you whatever item was to your bill. So you may find out your bil is an extra 60$ and when ask why they will say a bag of ruffles(like the bag you‚Äôd put in a child‚Äôs (lunchbox) had been removed from its place. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you tell them it‚Äôs still there and you accidentally moved it cause they will charge you. Also if your a serious gambler then it‚Äôs okay. But if just a random fun gambler plan on playing hands of blackjack for 25$ each at the lowest table and that pretty much goes for any tables there. Don‚Äôt eat anything at cafeteria and if any one does I challenge them to eat any one of their items blindfolded and correctly guess what it is. That would be the best odd I would get there. One thing though is the beds and pillows Rocked. They were awesome. But unfortunately when I go to Vegas I don‚Äôt go for room amenities. Anyway hope you have a better experience than we did. Good luck",1

I was there in July 2021 and October 2021. The rental was $900 in July because it was reserved just a couple weeks before. In October that same bed was $150. You get 1/2 the money back in food and beverage credit while you‚Äôre at the pool, but 2 people didn‚Äôt need $450 in food and beverage credit for our time at the pool.

So we left them in a elevator without a way of going. It won't go without a key card. But this was our experience. You decide. We won't ever use them again.",1
1557,jgarcia1971,Nov 2021,Our stay was flawless. Clean and well equipped suite. Our suite had dual AC thermostats which helped because the lady was cold and I was warm. Safety was no issue. The only hiccup was the digital room key. It didn't seem to work on my android so hard plastic keys were necessary. The hotel was booked solid EDC weekend.

Hopefully, if there was a problem with hotel cleanliness, it was a one time thing and has been resolved. Enjoy your trip!",1
1557,Simon P,Nov 2021,The tower room (strip view) was very clean with a soaking tub that the description didn't state. I had to use my room key to access my level in the elevator so the security is good. The lazy river was only open at weekends and I made the mistake on Sunday to buy a floatable ($30) not knowing that was the last day - I did get a refund for it.

I don‚Äôt know about the pools, I know they were opened when I was just there(Nov. 7th - 12th).

As far as the pool, you would have to call. I was surprised that the Lazy River closed by 5 and the pool by 8 when I was there. I do not know about that time of year. Enjoy your trip. It was the Lay River that sold me on staying there. Only one other hotel has one (not sure which and I do not want to mislead you). There are fancier hotels but I enjoy this one, I have stayed there a few times.",1

It was like 75 degrees outside. And of course on the strip you'll find show girls wearing next to nothing offering to take pictures with you and then they tell you you owe them $80. So avoid that. But if you do get a picture, or buy just about anything street vendor related, remember that everything is negotiable.",1

There is a jetted spa tub in the bathroom with a seperate shower, dual vanities. The Stay Well rooms have many great amenities, HEPA filter air in the room (for people with allergies its huge), healthy lighting features, aroma therapy diffuser, Vitamin added shower therapy. Two years ago I had basically the same room minus the Stay Well features. The Stay Well Rooms are much better, a little more money but worth staying in for the price.",1

Had not reopened, nor the new BBQ place by Michael Mina (I think its has now opened). The food court is open. Unfortunately almost all buffets are closed in Vegas.

Slot machines, every other machine shut off and chairs removed for social distancing. MANDATORY MASKS IN INDOOR PUBLIC AREAS AND OUTSIDE WHERE SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT POSSIBLE. Exception to rule is if you are drinking, eating, or smoking. When eating in a restaurant, mask while waiting to be seated, and after youre seated you can remove it to eat and drink. Employees are very on top of informing people to wear a mask properly, most people comply easily. Only saw one guy complain and after a few times of being told and he refused he was escorted out of casino by security. Public areas were really kept clean, hand washing stations throughout casino with disposable masks and gloves readily available. Hand sanitizer dispensers EVERYWHERE.",0

The next thing to keep in mind is that Las Vegas attracts hundreds of Chinese people and their really rude from personal experience. The rooms are not bad. You'll have to pay for parking everywhere you go on strip and Fremont. FYI, The rooms don't have coffee makers period anymore. Don't want to be a ""Debby Downer"" but being honest. I recommend taking Uber everywhere you go to.",2

You have two questions, first the hotel is clean, and all the staff including house keeping are Rey friendly and helpful. We stayed in the west wing king bed room both times. The hotel has everything you need and is very accessible to the strip. For your money you get a good safe place to stay. I know there are lots of opinions about this hotel and others, you can pay more to get other rooms at other hotels, but you know your budget. Now about the transportation we took a shuttle from airport to hotel the first time, then taxi back. This time we took taxi both ways $25 which included a nice tip, the trip was about $15 to $16 each way. We don't have uber, life or those other ride sharing services here in Vancouver, so we are not comfortable using it. I do understand it would be cheaper so if you like that service I would recommend that. Have a good trip, know about resort fees $37 plus taxes $4.95 per day on top of room rate.

Food delivery services will likely want you to meet them at the designated front entrance. This hotel has a designated area like Uber:Lyft.

On the other hand I encourage eating out, Vegas has come along way with their food and dinning experiences this is one huge reason why I travel there a lot! On my recent trip I felt very safe eating out and if you are vocal about any hangups when you make a reservation or once you‚Äôre there, I‚Äôve found staff is reasonable and caring.

If you have an auto there is free parking and so no worries. the MMM will amaze you tonnes of everything you seek and just off the casino The towers are to the best of my knowledge just the elevator banks making access to rooms easier. My wife and I were in the South Tower (9th Fl) and her parents (inlaws) were on the North (20th Fl) I gave them the upgrade overlooking the Bellagio fountains. But you can transverse by hallways from one tower to the other, The InLaws were visiting from Kenya and so you can understand they were in awe. Hope this is helpful Oh that MMM has all the eateries, all the stores that you can imagine ...we had a great time and will be making another trip this year...and probably back to PH.

Walk out one of the doors of the casino and you are on the promenade, which has everything from in and out burger to the tilted kit sports bar.

I actually went to the Mandalay Bay pools from 4/4 - 4/15 and they were fine. I even BOUGHT and BROUGHT a kiddie duck thermometer. It read 84 degrees in the Daylight Beach pool at Mandalay Bay (the party animal pool with super expensive drink service.) It's very tough to get into the Flamingo pools EVEN IF YOU HAVE A ROOM THERE. IF YOU'RE UP TO IT, WAIT IN LINE FOR 1.5 hours, and THEN get on the list. Or wait for that line to quickly vanish because people either entered the pool or they get put on a wait list. Another strategy: say about 25 minutes after they have processed people in the line, ... just casually walk up and get on the wait list. You might get a text at say 3 pm and eventually get in the pools without having to wait in line for 1.5 hours.",0

I drove to Von's grocery store for food, mostly. I utilized the free ice in the ice machine, and the smallish ice bucket in the room (and the sink in the bathroom.) You want a super great tasting, and super cheap value breakfast ? I'm serious as a heart attack when I tell you to go to the IHOP on Maryland Parkway about 3 miles to the East. They have a child's breakfast for $5.25 or thereabouts; fairly hearty even for an adult. There's a Ross store in the same shopping center. I bought some tennis shoes for $20. Uber or drive your own car. this isn't exactly breakfast, but Jaburritos Sushi Burritos has a $13 grab and go sushi / burrito type of thing. As you walk down the pedestrian ONLY, outdoor mall/street towards the huge, huge, huge ferris wheel ... it is about 2/3 of the way on your left.

The rooftop bars across either side don't close until 4am and the noise is deafening. It rattles the windows in the Jubilee Tower, which is the nicer rooms. Don't expect them to refund the difference in room prices when you move. They told me it was my decision to move. The pool is nothing fancy at all and the cliental is not what it used to be.

1870,Joseph F,Aug 2021,"No but I have a good insider tip for you. When you exit at the airport there is a private shuttle the ""Black"" van that stops at all major hotels and casinos including Bally's for only $10 and it runs every 30 minutes. It's much cheaper and convenient than taxis which are about $28 to the strip and Uber and Lyft can be a long wait and jacked up prices during prime times. I hope this helps you. You will love Bally's, ask for the Jubilee Tower Strip View room which has a wicked view of the Eiffel Tower.",0

1890,Scott J,Sep 2020,It is my understanding that one may be able to do that.

1894,Scotpod,Mar 2020,Hi. Ballys has two towers. The one nearest to the strip is the jubilee tower. When checking in I asked if my room (I was originally booked to stay in a king resort room) had a fridge and was informed no. Jubilee rooms did. I did get an upgrade. My room (6629) was large with 2 queen beds. Worth mentioning that there was no bath only a large walk in shower. Room did have a lovely view! I was only there for 5 nights so room was fine for my short break. Hope it helps.,3
1894,Trevor C,Mar 2020,"The jubilee tower is the one closest to the strip, and noise can be an issue, as can rooms in the resort tower if on the flamingo rd side, basically ask for high floor city view. All rooms have small fridges, hidden behind a plain door in one of the dressers, push to open the panel. Definitely ask for a king room, they have more space than the two queen bed rooms, and come with both a 3 seater couch and a comfy chair. Not sure when pool at Ballys will be open it was still under maintenance closure March 01, but you can actually access all Caesars group pool areas that are open, including the very nice Paris pool.",1

There is a charge to park in the structure, up to $15 a day, however if you are a Platinum, Diamond or Seven Seas total reward card holder, it is free. Same for valet, but the price is a little higher. The hotel has Resort Fees charged to every room, Cost is approximately $39 per night. Resort fees cover Wifi for two devices, access to the fitness center and one other benefit, I cannot recall.",0

Jubilee Tower has numerous rooms that face the strip, those rooms are a little larger than the Resort Tower rooms. The Resort Towers also have rooms that face the strip but are limited. If you want a little more room in the Resort Tower, they have a Jr. Suite. Wet bar, small dressing area and a bit more sq. footage. Check out the pricing. BTW, each room does have a refrigerator, but no coffee makers.",1
1907,Michael J,Jan 2020,Jubilee tower is the closest to the strip.,1
1907,DutchTraveler020,Jan 2020,"I was in the Jubilee tower and had great view on The Strip / The Eiffel Tower / Bellagio Lake (rooms on the other side of the hallway were overlooking The Strip as well, but then Caesers, The Venetian etc).",1
1907,malia_john,Jan 2020,Jubilee is closer but also has rooms not facing the strip. You will have to book through their 800# and speak to a rep to insure that you get what you want.,0
1908,MARTINE G,Jan 2020,They are free as you gamble at the tables or the slot machines. However the better you tip the more likely you will see your server come by. Specialty drinks are $10 or more If you simply order them at a bar or restaurant.,1
1908,bethf422,Jan 2020,I didnt order drinks at the casino I went to got Blizzed and ordered a bay breeze for 18.00 and refills are 9.00 for a 24ounce cup. My husband was buying beer at the bar for 8 and then started playing Black Jack and got them free for playing.,1
1908,Tammi420,Jan 2020,That is pretty accurate on drink prices. I have to admit... the pours on drinks make it worth it!! But it is Vegas.,0
1908,gamble4evr0001,Jan 2020,"I usually don't buy alcohol. When you play at the tables or on slot machines alcohol is free. However, if you want good alcohol and specialty drinks it will run about 12 to 20 depending the grade of alcohol and if it is a bar specialty drink. Sound about right. Most people buy alcohol at CVS and Walgreens to avoid the high cost.",0
1908,Cath B,Jan 2020,"hi, we didnt try. they will charge you everything! instead of including everything on the price shown before booking. we're travelling since 2011 its our first time to encounter this kind of hotel.",0

1910,Daniel SR,Jan 2020,I already booked and fully paid the room (4 nights) thru third party.

The check-in officer told that it possible and they don't require any deposit from my credit card.,0

1912,Jacque1127,Jan 2020,"I honestly am not sure, I took an Uber and it was only a couple bucks.",1
1913,Bobgpaa,Dec 2019,No you don't. Parking is by the day and you pay at the machines before you get back to the garage. It was $15/day self park. Not sure what valet costs. Also good to know that it is a very long walk to get to the Bally's side as the exits of the garage is into the Paris Casino. Have fun we did.,0
1913,Michael J,Dec 2019,No. Just the daily rate.,0

1914,Mabel2500,Dec 2019,In my opinion a debit card can be used as a credit card as well if they have a Visa or Master Card logo on it. As a rule of thumb call the hotel or casino registration and ask them. It‚Äôs establishment might have different requirements from another one.,1
1914,ecanzonieri,Dec 2019,"I used a credit card, but I think you can use a debit card.",0

1914,Thomas D,Dec 2019,No you need a credit card from what I was always told.,0
1914,Buckguy,Dec 2019,Check their website. I suspect not because they would want to put a hold on $100 and probably cannot do that on a debit card.,0

1916,Cynthia J,Dec 2019,Yes they do,0
1917,JasonFromArizona,Nov 2019,There is no phone check in for this hotel. What you can do is do a web check in and on that it will ask for your check in time. Note there what time you are arriving. That still won't 100% guarantee that you'll get the room type you reserved but your chances will be much better than if you just waited to check in.,0

1919,Departure140732,Feb 2020,"The pool was not open in November, probably because outdoor and they don't want to staff the area. The rooms are nice, no in room coffee. I recommend requesting and paying extra! It was $5 for a small coffee in the lobby coffee shop AND a long line in the morning. Of course, IF you go to the machines, and can order a coffee, it will be ""free"". Overall, though, a great stay, and would stay there again.",1

1923,lloriter,Feb 2020,"Nope. They used to as part of the Bally's family, but they stopped. Lyft or Uber is cheap. I don't recommend the generica airport shuttle, the last time I took it, Bally's was the last stop on the route. It took an hour to go just a couple of miles.",1

The shuttle stop is just across the road from hotel but is quite expensive so we used uber while there as you can walk to the strip from hotel and we got uber back,0
1956,herb v,Sep 2016,"NO. This is Las Vegas and the only way to get to the hotel, any hotel, is by taxi, shared van or Uber. There is no mass transit from the airport or any hotel shuttles unless you are a high roller - then you get a limo. Should be under $20 before a tip.

2004,Monty S,Jun 2020,"Hi, Yes - they have a mini-fridge, but it is NOT for your personal use. There are sensors in the fridge - If you move any of the items in the fridge, they are identified as consumed, and you will be charged for them (and then need to debate this with the Front Desk). Forget the shuttles in LV. I suggest that you get a transit pass - NOT a pass for the monorail, but a pass for for regular busses. You can buy them from vending machines at the main bus-stops (including the one at the airport). The busses run frequently, some run 24-hours/day, and , and are clean and safe. From the Sahara, one direction is to Freemont Street (downtown) and the other along the Strip. Also use them to get from/to the airport. We bought a package for the hotel, which had different deposit rules. You may find it advantageous to package your flight and hotel. Enjoy!",0

2066,Ernest S,Jan 2019,"Best option is using the ""deuce"" (double decker bus that runs the strip). That costs $6 for 2 hours, or $8 for 24 hours. They also have a $20 option for 3 days (72 hours). The shuttle service exists but only on certain days and to certain locations.",1
2066,andrewrI7420OE,Jan 2019,"Stacey Polo Towers couldn‚Äôt be much better placed on the strip, five minutes walk and you are about in the middle of the action. There is a bus that runs up and own the strip which is a really cheap way to get around, public buses are also really good. Not sure how you have booked but if you are a owner with Diamond Resorts and using your time share allocation to stay you also avoid all of the Nevada tourist taxes. Have a great time it‚Äôs amazing.",1
2066,Jeff L,Aug 2018,"As cheap as Uber is, don‚Äôt fret about the shuttle in my opinion",1

2066,PhlegmMaster,Aug 2018,"Hello. We used their free shuttle that took us to the Fremont Experience section of Downtown. it was a Sunday night, leaving Polo Towers at 7 PM. The return shuttle left the Fremont area at 10:30 PM to go back to Polo Towers. I think this shuttle was also offered on Friday night. I remember there was also a flyer in my room that mentioned a shuttle that went to a shopping district, but I didn't read the details. Just call the hotel at (702) 261-1000 and ask to speak to the front desk or the concierge to get more exact information. Good Luck!",1

2070,AllSportsOlympicPerformance,Jun 2018,No you can park oversized vehicle in outdoor parking nearby very convenient,1
2070,üñ§Allthingsmaple,Jun 2018,"Good question, yes there is a height limit and it is pretty tight in the underground garage. You will have to call Polo Towers as to the exact height allowed as I don‚Äôt know that off the top of my head. Most vehicles will fit though. It is also very small and if you don‚Äôt get there early you won‚Äôt get a spot. If you leave for dinner then I guarantee you won‚Äôt get a spot when you get back. There is a big outdoor parking lot behind the building though.",1
2070,monkey666,Jun 2018,They have an open lot. No ceiling. You are free to park anywhere in the lot. It is easy peasey. Secret back entrance to the building.,1

2085,Ernest S,Jan 2019,"I have had this happen at other locations. The reason is not so much the resort, but the bank. The resort does not take the money, they just put a hold on it. At checkout, the money is released from the hold, the resort NEVER gets the money, just puts a temporary hold on it. Banks often take up to 5 business days to release it back into your account.",0
2085,Argyro K,Nov 2017,Ask your rights not only from the desk manager but the general Manager as well. This borrow-by-force-HABIT the American hotels have is really ridiculous.They are not hosting beasts but travellers and they better insure their hotels than hold by force more money.,0

2085,daveblank1,Nov 2017,"Sorry to hear about your issue. I would put a stop on this with your Credit Card issuer first. Many things could have happened but like to other responder go to the front desk manager. The credit card issuer has a certain amount of time to reissue the credit. Usually within 2 days so it depends on when the credit was put in., I would follow up on Monday with the credit card issuer and then the front desk. I cannot remember having a problem like this before so I'm sure it should be a easy fix.",0

2102,Hairbykatherine,Jun 2017,They have a door in between them connecting the the entrances but I would assume that the door would be deadlocked so it can't be opened from either side. They are not going to have you connecting to another room unless you pay for 2 rooms,1

2102,Victoria P,Jun 2017,"Typically the answer is Yes. If there is a connecting door, it is locked. When you book, make sure management understands your needs. Also when checking in, verify the type of room you are getting.",0

In other words, your answers will be dependent upon the personal experiences of owners, who may not really know the correct or 'universal' situation throughout the Resort's three towers...I certainly don't feel confident to answer this one, so my advice is call the Resort, they will gladly answer the question properly, just understand without the suite number they will only be able to confirm if it's universal throughout the property or not.",0

We have room 19202 and looked over MGM Grand, Tropicana hotel and a few more. Polo Tower is only 1 block off of Las Vegas Blvd, so you can walk pretty much any where. Lots of restaurants, shops, bars etc right by you. New York New York is across the street along with many other hotels and casinos. If you get in the tower with the roof top swimming pool and spa, that's a nice section to be in also. The higher the better - get to see a lot of the city. The airport is right behind you, but don't hear it if you're inside the hotel. A great place to stay!!",0

2176,uniquely_sue,Jan 2020,I went one year for New Years Eve and saw the Fireworks from the rooftop of the Linq. You should be able to see it from your room if your room is facing the direction of Caesars. You may want to ask at the time of booking for a room facing the fireworks.,0

2189,Tdome,Sep 2019,I did not participate in that wonderful experience but I would assume the $300 is all you need to spend now and then the $300 will be applied to the $750 charge after the night is finished. Just call them to confirm. Beer and shots costs were normal so a big group eating food should hit the minimum.,0
2190,Rick F,Sep 2019,"I would suggest you stay somewhere else. This is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. Look next door (literally) at Harrah's.

2190,Mims1996,Sep 2019,There is a deposit hold placed on your credit card but no charges. If you don't use credit cards you may have to pay the deposit in cash and get a refund when you check out.

2191,Jennifer T,Aug 2019,give the person at the front desk a 20.00 and ask if they can upgrade you to something nicer than what you booked. The Linq is recently renovated and most rooms are the same anyways. They don't have many rooms that would be worth upgrading too unless you want a King suite which is roomier but nothing like across the street at Caesars.,1

2195,nplunkett3830,Jul 2019,We paid about $40 per night in resort fees for a 4 night stay. You can always ask them to see if any of your resort or room fees can be comped if you play at any Caesar's casinos. We did and it was well worth it. You will have to give them a credit card to hold or cash upon check in. Enjoy.,1
2195,Marco FDD,Jul 2019,"Hi, in February rates are usually pretty low depending on the week. If it's not a particularly busy week you should be able to stay at the Linq for just over $100 per night, taxes and resort fees included. On a total expense of about $600-650 the amount they hold from your card is roughly $100. As for reserving shows and restaurants, it will depend on which shows and restaurants you are looking to reserve. For the more popular ones I would probably look into it about a month in advance.",1
2195,mrgrasso,Aug 2019,Just left. It was $39 per night for resort fee. If you want to park it‚Äôs $15. They held $250 on my card,0

2196,ericagijsbers,Jul 2019,As much as you pay for the bus tickets to see Grand Canyon or Hoover Dam for a family you could probably just rent a car for and so you don't have to be on someone else's time.,1
2196,witaggar,Jul 2019,"You can either rent a car, which I recommend, or sign-up for one of the various bus tours that are available. You can do both places in one day, though the canyon is something you can explore for days-on-end. If you can afford it, the helicopter trips over the canyon are fantastic. Food options are all over the place. The Denny's someone mentioned is actually pretty good. The breakfast place at the Ling is good, while serving very large portions. I usually go downtown for dinner; the buffet at the nugget is decent and binnons (I think) offers nightly dinner specials (e.g., prime rib, steaks etc) Have fun!!!",1
2196,Kenni K,Jul 2019,"The Hoover Dam is easy to get to. I think it was $10 for parking. You can take a tour there, but we rented a car so we could leave when we wanted to.",1

2196,GeorgetteAudy2017,Jul 2019,Take grayline bus tour to Grand Canyon and Hoover. Long day of tours but well worth it west rim. Includes lunch. Ocean one in planet Hollywood great meals around 10.00 all day.,0
2196,opg1215,Jul 2019,First of all the LINQ pool area is for adults only. So if you‚Äôre planning to swim in the pool this is not the right place to stay with kids. Check out the Flamingo Hotel just right across the LINQ. Bigger & nicer pool. There‚Äôs so much eating places but yes Denny‚Äôs is the cheapest way to go. Flamingo/LINQ location is great. It‚Äôs right at the promenade lots of shops & restaurants including a famous burger place In n out burger. You can just walk to all the different hotels. To go to Arizona & Hoover dam yes need to rent a car for that. Do the High roller giant Ferris wheel in Vegas.,0

The rooms are not like the Nugget or D but they are clean and you cant beat this location on freemont. Plus NO rip off resort fee money grab. Depends what you want in a hotel I guess. I liked all the restaurants here, but if they are not to your liking there's dozens steps away out the front doors. Can't beat the price at 4 Queens, coming from Canada we already get raped on the exchange so this hotel works for us.",1

When I paid the bill, I thought how much cheaper I would have came out if I had gone to the already mentioned McDonalds next door.

Pack something special for that night and dress up to whatever level you feel comfortable. They no longer require it but people do seem to mostly dress for dinner at Hugo's. One of my favorite things about staying at the Four Queens is that the rest of the property is as casual as you want and i never felt like i had to dress up all the time like i feel at the strip hotels. I felt as comfortable in jeans and t-shirt in the morning and afternoon as i did in sequins and heals in the evenings.

I suggest you upgrade to a Premium room in the South Tower. A Premium room is well worth the $20 per night extra. My experience is that the front desk staff are helpful with personal requests. Give them a call.",1
2262,Starry R,Jul 2018,I would definitely contact the hotel. I can assure you those people are fantastic and will bend over backwards to assist you.

Again please give them a call and I hope you have a very very wonderful time there.,1

Do make the request however and specifically a south tower south facing room. Improve your chance by booking s larger room to accommodate your larger party.,0

2266,wpockoski,May 2018,"Taxi from the airport, $30 to $40, public bus from airport to 4 Queens, about $2 to $4, you need to go online to book, while it‚Äôs cheap you need to understand the running times and also there are many stops, one way to view the strip and hotels real cheap. While staying at the 4 Queens you can buy a all day bus pass for $8, you can get off and on as many times as you like, or a 3 day pass for around $18 I think. You teen will enjoy the downtown outside activity, there is a lot to see. It‚Äôs free. There are many trips available right from the hotel, independent sales reps will help show you various trips available and the various prices. I when to the dam which included a buffet, pretty cheap good food. Food at the 4 Queens is very good and fairly inexpensive. Sometimes if you are trying to save money you can go to a time share and get a free meal and show, includes free transportation. I never went I listen to there offers, they seem ok. There a lot to see so try not to rush to much and enjoy all the crazy people you see. The downtown area is very safe for your teen. I‚Äôm retired so I‚Äôm more cautious then most. Shorts and tees during the day. Usually each casino has a game room for teens to play games, cost money no sure how much. Make sure you ask for a players club card from the casino sometimes you get free meals or a 2 for 1 deal. Room at the 4 Queens were great, fantastic shower, tv is ok. Try not to get to overwhelm ed from all the activity. The room was very quite. I don‚Äôt think I saw one drunk person, there‚Äôs a lot of drinking but I don‚Äôt recall seeing a drunk person. Sometimes it‚Äôs fun just going into the side stores selling all kinds of junk. Macdonald in the center of downtown. The casino have really pretty cheap food because they are competing against each other. I usually do not go to shows any more, I‚Äôve been to many in the past. They are good. When your on the bus going from one casino to another just ask the people on the bus which show they would recommend, often times people will offer you free tickets they are not going to use. On one bus ride I got tickets for 6 different shows. Don‚Äôt often money for these tickets, just say your on a budget. Sometimes you can get free hamburgers or hotdogs just for walking into the casino. They will try anything just to look inside. Don‚Äôt get overwhelmed. It‚Äôs a lot of fun. Last time I got offers for free shows but did not go. I‚Äôm sure you will have a great time.",3

2266,JUDITH S,May 2018,"We both found taking the WAX bus wonderful and very fast. It is at the airport by the other busses, but has no numbers on the bus. It just says WAX on it. The cost was $2.00 a person and $1.00 for seniors. Not many stops like the other busses and you pay with bills. There is a luggage rack and it was close to the Four Queens. It will drop you off at 4th and Carson St. Directly across from the D's main entrance. Going back use the southbound Wax bus located by Casino Center Blvd. (next to Binions). We found the bus not crowded and easy to use and cheap. Sorry I can't help with tours as we didn't do any. Have fun. From the hotel to the strip the public transportation is cheap, but slow as it stops at so many places. The busses are called the Deuce and stops everywhere, but you need to purchase that ticket in advance at the vending machine located in many locations. The SDX bus is the express bus with fewer stops. Hope this helps.",1

Rented a car from enterprise at the D (just beside the 4 Queens) for 261$ all in for the rental car (mid size). Took a few trips to Grand Canyon, search the internet for discount or BOGO coupons before you go. There are 2 tours available normally, one to the Grand Canyon National Park and one to the Indian Reserve and Sky Walk. Although Sky Walk is neat, the view from the National Park is better (wider and deeper). Just have a great time, slow down when in Vegas and enjoy yourself.",0

It will take you to the Four Queens with only a few stops between. You can ask the bus driver about the stops and the cost was only $1.00 each for seniors or $2.00 for regular passengers. We found it very efficient and not many people know to use this way to get downtown. It makes only 1 stop and that is at New York New York and then goes to Downtown where it stops at a few places. Not hard to use and makes a return trip from Fremont Experience to the airport. Again not packed with people and fast.,4

The airlines learned this a long time ago. The casino is 'smoker-friendly' with ash trays by the machines. When booking a room, specify that you want a SMOKING ROOM. Enjoy & good luck $$",1

Make sure you get the one that ONLY comes Downtown. They will all come downtown however if you get one that also services the Strip then you will be stopping at all the Strip Hotels first before you come to Downtown. You can also make arrangement with the Bell Men for your return trip to the Airport. They also have the WAX bus you would need to check their times they stop 1 block down from us it runs approx. $3.00 per person.

2316,Michele R,Mar 2017,Hi. Thank you asking. The airport shuttles are normally on time and will drop you off close. Google transportation in Las Vegas and they will show you rates for various transportation options except for uber. Many are choosing uber these days and they will take you right to the door. Last I checked the shuttle is per person and 7.50 a person. Last check uber is about 20.00. Wifi is available at 8.99 per 24 hours per device. Depending on your needs there is a mcdonalds and Starbucks close that offers free wifi. All rooms have a shower. Some of the newly remodeled rooms have a shower panel which is incredible. We have Avis rental on property or you can catch the city bus just kitty corner to us by Binion's. I hope I answered your questions. Let me know if not. Have safe travels.,1
2316,Michele R,Mar 2017,Hi we don't offer tours but there are companies that do. But when you are walking around you will see many historical signs that tell you a lot. Personally speaking the most convenient form to the strip is uber. That is if you have a destination. If you want to go to various places I would catch the city bus and buy a day pass. Plan on doing a lot of walking,0
2316,682jeffl,Mar 2017,I am a local so most of your questions do not have any interest for me! There are 2 different public transportation express buses that go to and from the airport. The WAX and the CX! They pick up at terminals 1 and 3 and pick up downtown at Binions for just $2!,0
2316,hushpuppy81,Mar 2017,There is a bus that goes back and forth between the strip and Fremont St. I'm not sure about airport shuttle I had my car down there. The rooms do have showers and bath tubs and I think wifi was free,0
2316,isay691,Mar 2017,The WiFi is $8.99 per device. Unfortunately we had a car rental however Uber has an app that can give you an approximate price.,0
2316,avashneer,Mar 2017,Hello. Thank you for the reply. Which is the most convenient/affordable mode of transport to go around Las Vegas? Like back and forth to the strip? And do you provide tours around the area. Like helicopter ride of the strip or day trips to the grand canyon?,0

Nearby is the Hoffbrau Haus, a near authentic German beer garden bar. the waitresses were in their 60's, and they played a lot of polka music. It was very lame. The pool at The Virgin Hotel is great.

We were in the G building which Is your military right if facing the building. We walked the entire grounds every morning for exercise. It is convenient. I read a lot of reviews. My observation, Pool side is a little more noisy but it quite down later in the evening.. I guess it just depends on the time of year. Happy Travels",0

However those rooms are way inside the property thus walk from main road is a but longer n if u choose to walk, which we did . However if u like casino n nightlife u will love noisy n active environment . Also if one needs to have gym near by then that's another priority. If u like suuny hot rooms in mid winter like December than that's another priority so yes think about it n ask for what u want , they will probably cater to u !

I've been to Tuscany in 2018 for 8 days, 2019 for 12 days and I plan to stay 3 weeks in January 2020 so tells you how much I like it. Another option is the Carriage House which is about 4 blocks southwest of Tuscany. Carriage House is a time share but they rent open dates to the public. Includes a full kitchen if you plan a long stay, price is similar if not less money than Tuscany. Although there a parking lot for customers not much else.

2390,GOPHER41,Dec 2018,I wouldn't do it at night. You walk right in front of some bus stops where some of the questionable people congregate so you are just inches away from them. I didn't feel comfortable with that. Uber is so inexpensive and plentiful that it is just easier to do that at night- you'll be tired from walking around anyway so its a win win.,2
2390,Lewis07,Dec 2018,Everyone should be careful and be aware of their surroundings. But the area appears very safe with a lot of people moving around the same area you would be walking.,2

2390,VTL,May 2019,"I feel it‚Äôs safe so long you don‚Äôt walk on the Westin Hotel side. At the gas station next to Westin Hotel, there is always a bunch of homeless gathering there.

Safety is a personal thing, if you walk confidently and shadow families you still must be in your guard. Las Vegas is 24/7 but doesn‚Äôt mean the same kind of people are walking in daytime as nighttime.

2390,Peter H,Dec 2018,"I would no be comfortable if it was my wife late at night . It is not a bad area from my trips their. Their are people around 24 -7 Uber is everywhere and for a few bucks they will drop you of at the strips front door. I believe you quite safe on the strip all night. I do like the Tuscany. For 5 dollars a day you can get a bus pass, the buss stops in front of the tuscany across the street. It also gives you a option to see Fremont street. Have FUN",0
2390,Jackie R,Dec 2018,"I did it many times on my own in both daylight and dark, although it wasn't in the middle of the night. There are lots of people around so I felt quite safe. It is only 2 blocks from the strip and it is a busy road leading up to the strip.",0

2396,Sam E,Sep 2019,It is about $36 dollar with tax daily. For me it just gets free average speed internet and feeling of ripped off but that is almost all hotels in Vegas.,0
2396,Maryam R,Jun 2018,"It is per room . Free Wifi and parking . Some coupons for drink , dinner and $10 for slot machines included.",0
2396,L.J. R,Jun 2018,Tax is indeed obligatory and said gets one all the things that just normally came with any hotel. It's part of the LV greed thing. I won't pay it again!,0
2396,tatterdema,Jun 2018,"Yes, it is mandatory, per room, and does not get you anything besides parking, use of the facilities, and a couple coupons.",0

2397,D'Arcy E. Barker,Jun 2018,"Regardless of the hotel, most cabanas are generally expensive and provide their own shade (and some even have air conditioning). But unless you're going to spend all day at the pool, and you have children, they probably aren't worth the money.",1
2397,BugBarbecue,Sep 2018,"Yes, we rented a cabana for two days, back in June. We ended up with the small one the first time, and the larger one the second. They are well worth it, as there is limited shade in the pool area. The fridges are stocked with water, and the waitress hits the cabana's first when making the rounds. The only bad thing to share, are the TV's getting terrible reception. But that's wasn't a big issue for us. Our biggest complaint, was in the area the Cabana's are. There is a back gate in the cabana area that is supposed to be for employees only. But guests, especially kids, were going in and out of it, trampling thru our area. Hell, we even had some lady, sit in one our chairs, under our tent while she talked the phone after she came thru the gate. If i'm paying cabana prices, I want cabana privacy. The waitress, to her credit, would shoo anyone out. But, she shouldn't have to do that in the first place.",0

2397,uc1960,Jun 2018,"Hi, sorry can't help you there. Did not go to the pool area since it was being worked on (it was November/December, nice but still November/December üòÄ).",0
2397,wjm101012016,Jun 2018,I dont recall seeing cabanas for rent. The pool area is nice but not very large like the strip hotels.,0
2397,zlmmer,Jun 2018,Yes we do intend on spending a day at the pool. The cost is $113 with tax on a weekday which isn't bad because we will be splitting it with another couple. I realize they provide shade I was wondering if the sun shines in on them or if they are located in the shade. Makes a difference in 100 degree + temps. It's our 25th anniversary and we wanted to do something special at the Tuscany that day. (Besides drinking and gambling) lol,0
2397,517jeanettet,Jul 2018,I did not see a reason for cabana. People were quiet and children stayed in areas with their families . I fell asleep it was so peaceful. Enjoy your get away.,-1

2402,uc1960,May 2018,"Hi, they do not have a shuttle service. You might be able to make a deal with one of the cab drivers. I did and he took me to several places, just had to call his cell. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel (both ways), but going up to the strip you have to go across Flamingo and it might take a while. Nothing in Las Vegas is a short distance. One of the reasonsmy Mom, 88, is not going with me anymore. You might want to rethink, or drink e every place - not advisable though because of the traffic and parking. Hope this helped some.",2
2402,slbenz,May 2018,"Unfortunately, they do not provide shuttle services to the ""Strip"". As others have said, you need to use a taxi service. What I did since I had a rental car, there are still a couple of areas along the strip that you can still park for free. Just Google search and you will find them. Treasure Island is one that I used to park for free.",2
2402,Flyer521810,May 2018,"We used Uber or taxis. Uber can pick you up at your building so your Dad doesn‚Äôt have to walk too far around the hotel.

2406,Gail S,Mar 2018,I guess you could say that but from what I recall it is 1-3 short blocks away from Bally‚Äôs. Like a 5-min Drive. I stayed at Bally‚Äôs & my friends stayed at Tuscany but we all shared 1-car so we all visited both hotels. The Restaurant at Tuscany was excellent & prices were extremely reasonable.

2412,Mary K,Dec 2017,Uber. FYI the Uber line is different from the Taxi Line. Watch your signs. But it‚Äôs only a couple of miles from airport to hotel. So it‚Äôs probably just a couple of dollars different. Either should be under $15 for two people. Always tell your driver to ‚Äútake Swenson to Harmon and right on Paradise‚Äù. It‚Äôs an east and fast ride.,0

2413,Michael T,Nov 2017,"I stayed at the Tuscany last week. Wifi is free in the rooms but yes, it is at a slower rate. You pay extra for each day for high speed internet. The slower rate is just fine for checking emails and such.",2
2413,nbrownlaw,Nov 2017,The WiFi is free but they do offer faster options for a charge. I had no trouble checking email and pulling up documents/reviews to read in the room and in common areas.,1
2413,Chuck W,Nov 2017,You get free wifi in the rooms but you have the option to pay for a faster wifi. I found the free wifi worked well. You do have to log into it everyday you are there. To be honest I was there to go and see things not sit in my room being on my phone or computer. When you log in it says you are paying but you aren't I did call the front desk to ask about logging in and they told me I wouldn't be charged for it and I wasn't.,1
2413,OregonAstronomer,Nov 2017,"When we were there earlier this year, the free wi-if in the room was unusable because of the speeds which were inconsistently averaging a meg. You could pay for a 5 meg option but it was expensive. Also, if you are a Verizon data user, be aware that the cell coverage there is spotty so 4G is not a viable option.",1
2413,Elizabeth C,Nov 2017,"Wi Fi was free in our room and in the public and cafe areas. What's probably confusing people (because it confused me initially too!) is that the log in process has you ""choose a package"" but when you do, it comes out at nil cost. It's just that confusing step that gives another impression. Of course there are options to pay for more wifi but we never needed to do that over the 3 days we stayed. I was able to do my remote work pretty easily without slow speeds.",1
2413,Griff99,Nov 2017,We had no problem with the free wifi in the room.,0
2414,eaglejohn1,Oct 2017,what is the question?,0
2415,eaglejohn1,Oct 2017,incidental I believe is $50-$100 per night. Use credit card and won't notice/ They do not like to take debit Same as any other day,1
2416,Joni M,Oct 2017,Pretty sure the pool is open year around. There is a lap pool outside the fitness center and then the big pool and hot tub outside.,0
2417,Nancy S,Sep 2017,They have music in the bar at night without a cover charge and the drinks are reasonable. A lot of local residents go here to dance at night.,1

2423,Mary K,Sep 2017,"Totally. You can take them through the hotel without having to take them through the Casino. The 'Marilyn's Cafe"" is in the casino but by the back door so very little kid exposure. And the prices are great and the food is really good. There is a Bottega Coffee Breakfast shop which is outstanding and you can get there from the pool side or the hotel hallway lobby side - no Casino again if that is important. The Bottega is my favorite place ever for muffins, rolls and pastry. They also have oatmeal, egg sandwiches and more. And great coffee. Stumptown brand. Not that burned bean stuff you get at a 'bucks'. (which is across the street). So yes, kid friendly, big rooms for a family to move around in and lots to do.",0

2423,Trish D,Jul 2017,Yes kid friendly but its not Circus Circus where they have games etc for kids to play. Their small casino is separate from the hotel. So definitely away from all the adult action if that's what your asking.,0

2426,Mary K,Sep 2017,"The answer is yes and it's heated - baring some unforeseen event. It's a year round pool. And just by the pool are lots of lounges, tables and chairs with umbrellas and the adjoining patio areas with fire pits / fireplaces and lots of conversation room. The Piazza (inside bar/stage/music/) has a different band performer almost every night and they are some of the best musicians in Las Vegas - so lucky the Tuscany got them!

2426,Trish D,Jul 2017,Hi Jennifer - I am unsure about the pool. Yes August in Vegas will be extremely hot. The walk to the strip is quite far and will seem even further with the heat and walking with a small child. I would suggest finding something closer to the strip.,1
2426,Wilsonvic,Jul 2017,Not sure how long pool open for. Will be too far for four year old to walk to strip. There is a bus stop across from hotel that stops at strip.,1
2426,ADavisS,Jul 2017,"yes, you can walk to Strip - I agree with other answers but no idea about status of pool.",1
2426,Cindy K,Jul 2017,"The fitness center pool closed around 10 pm. The hotel pool was being tiled, so I don't know about that one. The outdoor walking to the strip can be greatly reduced by entering Ballys and walking inside or getting on the Monorail at the Ballys station.",1
2426,Mjk5238,Jul 2017,"I think walking to the strip is nice and short for an adult, but with smaller children I recommend using Uber or a taxi. The walk from the hotel to the base of the strip is approx, 1/2 mile. So, it really depends on how the child reacts to walking in big crowds If you do decide to walk it out, keep in mind that there's plenty of places to pop into along the way to cool down and keep your 4 year old entertained. Have fun!!!",1
2426,tmhmichael,Jul 2017,It's a long 2 blocks to strip. Be miserable in August strip is very long too. I would call uber. It's like 5 bucks was there in feb. didn't use pools. But they look nice,1

2427,Mary K,Sep 2017,"No but a cab ride should only be $12-$15 - and be sure to tell the driver to ""take Swenson to Paradise"" so you don't get a 'long haul'. The airport also has an Uber line - be sure to ask where to go because it's different from the taxi line. Either of them are easy.",0

2427,Nancy S,Jun 2017,There is no transportation that is provided by the hotel. It is a short cab ride to the hotel. We have taken our car on two different occasions and parking was easy compared to parking in the garage in most of the other hotels. There is a series of two story villas that have parking outside. The parking is part of your resort fee. When I was younger we used to walk from Tuscany to many of the nearby hotels. It hurts my hips to walk on concrete now and we take cabs. When we drove from AZ we drove during the day and took cabs at night since we drink at night and don't want to drive and it is harder to find your way around the strip at night.,0
2427,Dan S,Jun 2017,Not sure,0

2429,Mary K,Sep 2017,"This is one of the best things about the Tuscany. Strip hotels charge at least $20/day for you to use the garage - same with Valet. Tuscany does NOT charge, they give you a dash tag when you check in so they can monitor the lot cars if needed. I've seen RV's, U-Hauls, semi trailers, etc, in the lot - plenty of parking and there is always a security guy out there on a bike or walking around. Best thing you can park near your building/room. Locals don't go to the strip anymore because of the greedy parking fees. Shame on them. LOVE the Tuscany.",1
2430,Evelyn M,May 2017,It's very easy for them to find you and we only paid about 5-7 bucks per ride to the strip (Uber),1

Personally I would Uber this - but during a big show like Cowboy Christmas, MAJIC, or Consumer Electronics (CES) there are swarms of people walking to these venues from everywhere - including Tuscany. Again, my feet aren't up for that walk plus the convention booth stroll -- I think it's a couple of miles, all sidewalk and lots of traffic on a smaller street. Hope that helps.",0
2431,Cathie B,Apr 2021,Can I get an Uber at 3am from the airport in Las Vegas?,0
2431,Mary K,Sep 2017,"Either are safe. The airport has a dedicated Uber line - and the drive is only about 10 minutes in traffic from airport to hotel. There is also a taxi line but always mention to the taxi driver to take ""Swenson to Paradise"" so you don't get a 'long haul' and pay more. It costs me about $10 from my condo - near the Tuscany - to the airport. NO big deal. And the airport is a very busy 24/7 place. Don't be afraid. It's all good. And at the Tuscany you'll be dropped off just outside the reception area, well lighted with security and/or Valet.",0
2431,Freqt568,May 2017,Pretty safe to take uber in LV. Did it all the time and no problem. Hotel staff informed us that police is everywhere in dowtown LV even some of the homeless are undercover police.,0
2431,Nanatobauer,May 2017,We used UBER both ways to the airport. Worked great.,0

2432,Mary K,Sep 2017,"Tuscany to the strip is well lit and all sidewalks and usually people walking back and forth.

It's a ten minute walk that seems shorter because there is always something to see - but no matter where you are in the world, use common sense, wear walking shoes (I see ladies in heels and have to cringe!!) and move with purpose. And remember in Vegas you are always on camera. Vegas is a serious security place and Metro (our police) take your safety very seriously. Hope that helps.",1

2466,Buckguy,Mar 2019,While I cannot say with 100% certainty but I think I can say with a high degree of confidence that any casino pool with that has a liquor license to serve drinks poolside must not allow you to bring your own alcoholic beverages to the pool if they can see it is an alcoholic beverage. Like others have answered if you are discreet and behave well you will probably not get hassled. Maybe buy something from the servers at the pool to not attract attention to your own beverages. As long as you behave I would think the worst that would happen is that you would be asked to leave or put the beverages away.,1
2466,the travelor,Mar 2019,Don't think do,1

2467,killerrat007,Feb 2019,"what is the actual difference between the deluxe suites, the deluxe masquerade suites, the luxury suites and the premium suites? Depends on what tower you are in, that is why they are a little different (color, decor, view, etc.). It is all a preference, what do you like - what I like is different than others - but the rooms are larger than other rooms on the strip (for the price), but it is off the strip and you will have to walk or take a cab/ride share to get to the Strip (The Rio does have free parking, so that is a HUGE plus!) The Masquerade suites are different and you don't usually find them online - but those are 1600SqFt each, which if you really want to have fun and see 180 degrees that is the way to go. They do have penthouses and the Palazzo Villas and those are very, very nice - but if cost is a factor, they are not for you.",1
2467,Mark S,Jan 2019,I prefer Ipanema(sp?) tower. Beer and closer to convention hallway. All rooms suites and pretty similar. Luxury are a little newer and upgraded furnishings. There are larger suites but much more expensive. Basic rooms are a little dated but very cost effective and good service throughout. Don‚Äôt miss Hash house a gogo for breakfast or lunch.,1

At the $25 blackjack tables, there was no lack of service. If you were empty, they were pretty much right there to freshen you up. All in all, they take very good care of you at the Rio.

Goggle Fremont Experience you will see a covered street and the Fremont is on this street. When you hear the term Downtown Vegas it refers to historic center of Vegas or you can say the older part. The nice part of the downtown area like the Fremont Casino is how easy walking around and exploring many casinos and restaurants within 1/2 mile. The strip is not something you can walk to from Fremont it must be about 10 miles south.,1

I contacted the hotel and filed a case for at lease the physical therapy charge, but they dismissed my case and said they did not have responsibility for my injury. I really liked staying at the Rio, but now??? No way. They would not even accept the responsibility for their faulty bathroom. Are we as Hotel patrons supposed to repair their rooms???",0

2483,cainet777,Jul 2018,I heard that Rio no longer offers the amazing seafood selection that they used to as an add-on upgrade to the standard buffet admission effective this month (July 2018). I would encourage you to explore the ‚ÄúBuffet-of-Buffets‚Äù pass that you can use to enter most of the buffets at Caesar‚Äôs Entertainment properties for 24 hours. I believe that costs $45-$50 and you can pay to upgrade so that you can go to the Bachannal Buffet at Caesar‚Äôs. Bacchanal is the best buffet in Vegas and has a lot of fresh seafood.,1

If you rent a car, as I do, the expressway is very easy to get on and off to go downtown, other parts of Las Vegas, Hoover Dam, etc.",0

2502,zgshaw,Nov 2017,"All of the ""Resort hotels"" in Vegas now are getting around inexpensive room rates by charging resort fees, which are usually about the same cost as a reduced room rate, $40 or more. The only way to avoid these fees is to stay at a hotel/motel, not associated with a resort, like a Holiday Inn or La Quinta. The parking at the Rio was not very convenient but there was no extra charge unless you use the Valet Parking. Just to the west of the Rio a few blocks are a selection of normal, USA urban eating choices. One nice thing about the Rio is quick and easy on and off the freeway, if it is a quick stay.",0
2502,williammB5345LJ,Nov 2017,Not sure what you mean about extra charges for the rooms. Las Vegas has many additional fees so when you get a room for say $59 there's typically another 40 or so dollars per night for Resort fees taxes etcetera. When I say that the real my room was $39 but the actual cost was closer to 80. There's a great 24 hour restaurant in the hotel that has amazingly good breakfast and even better service. Because it's Las Vegas they offer many great drinks to for breakfast. If you're a light eater you maby want to consider ordering one breakfast and sharing it. There's a chicken waffle item on the menu that is outrageous and beautiful to look at also. If you order a side plate of fruit or something light that meal is good enough to share and very very delicious. Many of the other restaurants open late so you can just ask for the 24-hour cafe. I don't remember the name off the top my head right now but it's really great and as I said before the service is outstanding,0

2508,KatP413,Aug 2017,"It really depends on what is most important to you, when traveling to Vegas with children. Also the age of the children matters too. If the luxury of a nice room is important, but also kid friendly I would suggest RIO. Rio is all suite, so the rooms are bigger, more space for kiddos. China town is just down the road, get an Uber and go explore. It's a lot of fun. Excalibur is best for 5-10 year olds. Lots of games, tournament of champions (think medieval times theme). New York New York is good for the little bit older into teens group. Roller Coaster, arcade (think Dave and Busters on steroids). Circus Circus is a fun outing at the Adventure dome. I don't like Circus Circus for their rooms, but they are passable, but with kids, you never know when you are going to have to chill in the room. Stratosphere can also be fun for the teenage group, with the daredevil type roller coasters at the top, plus the Pawn Stars Pawn shop is practically across the street from here. If you have a kiddo into animals I'd suggest Mirage. They have the dolphin habitat and the Tigers. Really all hotels are kid friendly in Vegas, just depends on your kids. They can walk through the casino they just have to stay on the path and can't cut through the floor with tables themselves. Also, I don't know of any hotel in Vegas that is All-Inclusive. You pay for things separately. That being said, so hotels offer deals so check their websites or call them. I know the Caesar's group has a great call center.",0
2508,Leon C,Aug 2017,"I would suggest the rio. Mostly because of the larger rooms and ease of parking. Its off strip so you may have to travel a bit.

2516,Randi K,Aug 2017,"They will charge you for early check in - so you might want to just check your bags with the BellHop out front, then go enjoy yourself until check-in time.",1
2517,Robert R,Jul 2017,"You cant smoke it in public or in hotel, but don't worry my room smelt of some pretty good weed when I checked in so I doubt it is enforced in the rooms unless you have lame neighbors that tell on you.",0
2517,Evelyn A,Jul 2017,I am not entirely sure since I cant smoke marijuana (job). I would recommend calling them and asking. There is a website (kushtourism) recommending the discrete use of edibles and vaporizers when possible.,0
2518,Gary B,Jul 2017,"Each time I stayed, it was a tub/shower combo. Rooms are nice, but I don't like staying there. As for a long walk to the strip or cab/Uber ride, you can always take the shuttle from Rio to Bally/s which is convenient to several casinos on the Strip.",1
2518,barkinbarb,Jul 2017,They are tub/shower units.,1
2518,Jamie M,Jun 2017,"Hey, there's a tub with a shower.. if that makes sense? Bear in mind it's a little walk from the strip. Had to get an √ºber back most nights",1

2519,Jackie702,Jun 2017,Ipanema tower has the upgraded rooms I always ask for that tower and honestly I'm there 1-3 times a month (Pool view is my favorite it's also the strip view and Zipline as well!!!),0
2520,Jacqueline C,Jun 2017,I was there in January it was not open,-1
2521,ninab927,Jun 2017,The room I had was in the Ipanema Tower ...NO UPDATE in my room,1
2521,Deven H,Jun 2017,The masquerade tower is the updated tower. We were first booked in the other one and it was some outdated with low ceiling and dark that we asked to move. It was much better to be a high floor with a much more updated room.,0
2521,carl j,Jun 2017,"We have stayed in both the Ipanema and the Masquerade suites. We stay twice a year for business, we always ask for the Masquerade tower, just because we don't like walking thru the casino every time and smelling all the cigarette smoke just to get to our room. The Ipanema tower is newer, and a little nicer. BUT, we have also stayed in what they call the Fat Tuesday suite a couple of times, for four days at a time. (@$600.00 a nite) Those are in the Masquerade tower. If you would like a nice room for less, ask for a end suite in the Masquerade tower. (example room 19001) They are very nice, two bathrooms, a living room, dinning room, coat closet, and separate bedroom. Two TV's, and a separate bathroom with a Jacuzzi tub, separate shower and a small walk-in closet, etc.. But, the past couple of times we stayed they told use the Masquerade towers were all booked and put us in the Ipanema tower even though we had made our reservations weeks in advance, for the Masquerade tower. They told us they could not promise a certain tower that it is just a request. SO now we are going to stay at another hotel. Enough is enough. There are a lot newer and nicer hotels for less. Trust me on this one!!",0
2521,edwardcarr2968,Jun 2017,"Last week, I was in the Ipannema tower (shorter, newer tower) on the 12th floor, strip view. Room was not updated, and overall condition of the hotel has fallen below acceptable conditions compared with the last time I stayed at the Rio in 2007.",0
2521,Sealrub,Jun 2017,"I just got back from there Wed, they do have 2 separate tower sections I stayed in the taller and older of the 2 sections. As I understand they do have some updated rooms in different sections. I also stayed in the Masquerade Tower one night on the 12th floor and then 6 days on the 20th floor both facing the strip, Not as good as it sounds due to the position of the tower neither of rooms were updated. Bottom line I can't tell you if your room was ever updated but one would think the suites would be the 1st rooms redone. Allow me to suggest you simply call the front desk and ask about the room they have that kind of info a their finger tips.",0
2522,kevan m,Jun 2017,The main difference is the size...some delux suits have really nice views too..we have stayed in both rooms and neither one of them are bad..if money isn't an issue just book delux for the space otherwise book a regular room early and ask for a nice view if available.,1 vote
2523,saxyroro,Jun 2017,Ask about an upgrade to a better suite. Last time I was there they offer me an upgrade to a huge suite for $75 more per night. Also the smasher burger and the hash a gogo kitchen r awesome places to eat for a great value. The chinese place does authentic Dim Sum everyday for lunch. Enjoy,1
2523,Shaun B,Jun 2017,The deluxe - but not by a great deal. I'd also recommend not getting Strip view - I've been there several times and it always seems like the Strip view rooms are smaller and older.,0
2524,Austrian,Jun 2017,50 sq feet and more furniture. Can't help you with the other part of your question.,1
2524,readerlady,Jul 2017,Usually the price upgrade and probably the floor you are placed on or the view of the city or the mountains affects the price and the room category. We were in a standard room and did not use the pool.,0
2525,tupperwareboy,May 2017,I would take a cab or maybe an Uber.,2
2525,Karen C,May 2017,Definately take Uber so much cheaper,1
2525,LaTonya J,May 2017,"Rio does have a shuttle that lets you off right in front of the High Roller by the Linq and Flamingo however, I'm thinking the shuttle is for the Rio guests only. My suggestion would be Uber or Lyft. From my experiences Lyft has been the least expensive. Uber was still cheaper than the cab. However, the cab was most convenient.",1
2525,Alan S,May 2017,I think that there is a shuttle to Rio that picks up at Flamingo. I took it once a while back and it worked out fine. Cab will work if nothing else.,1
2525,Niaisha D,Jul 2017,Uber or lyft,0
2525,Shaun B,Jun 2017,"You could take the RTC bus (local bus) but buy your ticket OFF the Strip - buy it on the bus going on Tropicana, $5 for a 24 hour pass - then catch the Deuce going north on the Strip to Flamingo (or heck, walk up the Strip if you have time, pretty cool sights)",0
2525,Austrian,Jun 2017,"No shuttle, just a cab. Pretend you stay here often or take you the Tourist way.",0
2525,Rogerl53,Jun 2017,"Really, no such things as shuttles, although the Rio has one between there and Harrah's. It is probably highly crowded in the evening. Uber is ""off in the boondocks"" and does not pickup or deliver in ""prime"" area of the hotel fronts. Cab is the ""standard"" method, although, as somebody mentioned, Uber may be less expensive.",0
2526,readerlady,Jul 2017,There are two breakfast restaurants that I saw one is a Hash place on casino level and another was a buffet. Don't know what the items in the buffet were but the Hash place had lots of good items on the menu. We didn't use either though. Sorry,0
2526,Shaun B,Jun 2017,"The buffet is nice, aim for 10:30a so you can do a breakfast/lunch combo. Starbucks is there, they are all the same. I wasn't a big fan of Hash-House, tasty, but tons of carbs. But for a really nice breakfast - go west on Flamingo and when you hit Decatur (about a mile or so) there is a restaurant called ""Blueberry Hill"" - all the locals go there, FANTASTIC breakfast!",0
2526,anphro3,Jun 2017,"I would go to Hash House and split a meal, the meals are so large two can eat from them. They offer everything you could think of. At the All American grill they have your typical Eggs, Omelette french toast breakfast, good but very typical",0

2528,roghare,May 2017,Hi Yes the Bell person can take your luggage and give you are ticket for each bag. Then after you check in and go to your room you call the bell man and they will deliver your baggage and you give them your tickets to prove that they are your bags. And normally tip the bellman $5.00 for each bag but it is up to you what you tip.,0
2528,ruralroad2017,May 2017,"Yes, you may check your bags at the bell stand upon arrival and also after check out",0

2531,roghare,May 2017,"The Cromwell has a roof top pool and bar and nightclub. Drinks are expensive just talked to someone that got two drinks at Caesar Palace and it cost him $45.00 with included a automatic 18% in the bill which is the tip. Usually a cover charge for everything and on the strip if you have a car you have to pay for parking. $10 to $15 a day for self parking. The Rio does not charge for parking. Check out Groupon for Las Vegas you can get discounts on food, get VIP club passes so your line is only 20 people instead of a line of over 200 people. Good Luck bring alot of money check out the M resort it is off the strip but they have a shuttle which is at the airport and will shuttle you to the strip too. Week days the Tables are $5.00 and on Weekend you would be lucky to find a $15.00 table.",1

2532,Cassie P,Apr 2017,My boyfriend and I both have Samsung Galaxy s7 Edge and they worked fine! No trouble at all. As another user stated you can only use a couple devices per room # so maybe that would be the only issue. But otherwise even with how many people are there it runs amazing.,1
2532,mamasue52,Apr 2017,We had no problems. My son has an older model Samsung phone and mine is a Motorola Moto G4 Play. There are limits on how many devices you use. Perhaps someone had trouble because of that.,1

If an accident occurs the pools owner or the property's owner are not responsible.There are no lifeguards on duty majority of the time that is why solo swimming are prohibited. You must have a key to have access to the pool/gate. There were too many children drownings due to open gates Zaza so keeping it closed.You must check in.You must register at the front desk.You must be a guest of the Hotel/Resort again...

2582,LaShawnda M,Aug 2019,The resort fee you do not get back that is just what you pay for staying at that particular Hotel. Circus Circus has some of the cheaper Resort fees. Now you will also not have to pay a holding fee. Some of the hotels you have to pay holding fee also and they give it back to you within 7 to 10 business days.

2610,Jeannine L,Sep 2018,It probably depends on how old your kids are. We had 2 adults and an 8 and 9 year old and it was fine. One more would've probably been pretty cramped. If you have smaller kids it'd probably be fine though.,0

2633,Graham Hearsey,Apr 2018,I visited and would say there‚Äôs no smell or odours,1
2633,Gillian E,Apr 2018,I did not find the place dirty and I went during busy season. The rooms do not smell. The casino area does have an odor but I think because it is old. I enjoyed my stay at circus circus,1
2634,Zhavonna P,Apr 2018,I would cancel that reservations if I was you. The pictures they use to show off hotel is from the 70s and it hasn't been updated. Dirty room and smoke filled halls are in your future of you stay there. I only booked it because I decided to go to Vegas a day early and need a hotel room. I should have paid the extra $160 the stratosphere hotel wanted.,1

2634,Edward W,Apr 2018,I stay at Circus Circus several times a year with my family - I had the same concerns the first time we stayed but the majority of complaints are people who booked the really cheap Manor rooms from 3rd party sites. if you stay in one of the three towers it's standard MGM rooms at a good price.,0
2635,tomikapettiford02,Apr 2018,Yes if you are a guest in the hotel the water slides are free.That are you want to stay in is fine; no noiseüòä,1
2635,Edward W,Apr 2018,"Water park is free for 4 persons per room. I like the West Tower although prefer Casino tower because we go back and forth to our room and the West Tower is 35 floors which can take awhile on a busy weekend. I've never heard noise but once from a small group of people in the hallway. if smoke bothers you ask for a room a few doors away from elevator in Casino Tower. the air circulation does seem to have improved. The sky Rise tower is closest to parking, pool and adventure done.",0

It was the perfect spot for what we needed, even though we were hardly in the room only to sleep, shower and change clothes. It provides easy access to the the hotel‚Äôs pools and the excitement of The Adventuredome. These rooms also have new carpet, flat-screen TVs, pillow-top mattresses and Wi-Fi Internet access. The only thing I didn't like is that the room didn't come with a microwave nor refrigerator.",1

2646,pupsrool,Oct 2017,"HI....I have never found any problem with the bedding, but did see a crack in the bathroom wall once. Don't care...if you look for the negative you will find it.

If you did it on-line then try to make the changes on-line through the same source. Since the Resort has what they call ""third party reservations"", they most likely will tell you that they can't make the change. If you booked with the Resort directly then they should be able to make changes, on-line or by phone. The one problem I see is that they may not have a vacancy for the additional date. If all else fails, call the Resort to see if they can help you make the changes. Good luck!",0

2673,KB & ME,Feb 2017,No shuttle to/from airport but hotel is fairly close to the airport. I think the fare was about 20.00 US.,0
2673,Martha H,Jan 2017,I used Uber to get to airport,0
2673,islandlass2,Jan 2017,"The Resort does not provide shuttle service to/from the airport. However, Super Shuttle is available and easy to book online. Resort does provide a shuttle to the Strip. UBER also operates in Las Vegas but I have not used them.",0
2673,lmargeso,Jan 2017,No there is not a airport shuttle.,0
2673,Kajal M,Jan 2017,Nothing more to add to the above two responses. I fully agree that being away from the hustle & bustle of the Strip was a great welcome respite.,0
2673,musiknalldat,Jan 2017,"The is a shuttle, but it's just to The Strip, Fremont St., and major areas. There is a cab stand with a corral line at the airport that moves pretty fast and the cost of the taxi is very reasonable. We used UBER the entire time to get around from the Tahiti, but once, and it was great. The Tahiti in case you aren't aware is about 3 miles from The Strip, but it is actually a respite from the non-stop hustle of The Strip. There is a large strip mall next to it with a 24 hr. Walgreens, and several well known food chains. Have a great time!!",0
2673,Mike C,Jan 2017,"No, there is a shuttle to the strip which runs every hour, but no airport shuttle. A taxi to or from the airport should cost maximum 25 dollars",0

2674,imoguz,Jul 2017,"mini kitchen is a microwave. My 2 bedroom unit also had an oven and I do not remember if the adjacent I bedroom unit had an oven too. I think you should call to check. For my booking, I booked a 2 bedroom unit with an adjoining 1 bedroom unit and both units were well equipped, but not so sure if we did everything in the 2 bedroom unit as that unit was bigger.",0
2674,dmjewel,Nov 2016,"I think mkb607 is talking about the 1 bedroom and not the studio. The studio is the knock off to the bigger 1 bedroom with balcony. It is only one room and has some appliances. Kind of like a hotel room than a villa, IMHO.",0
2674,mkb607,Nov 2016,"The studio, actually a smaller 1 bedroom unit, has a king size bed in the bedroom and a sleeper sofa in the living room. It is probably a full size, but it is comfortable. There is privacy. The bedroom is separate from the kitchen and living room area. The kitchen has a mini frig, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, full set of dishes and silverware. If there is something you need, just call and if they have it, they will bring it to you.",0

2677,123ara,Jun 2016,Nothing in the rooms or building but you are allowed to smoke on your patio and outside the main entrance. Not by the pools or hot tub.,0

2680,SteDar,Feb 2016,I believe the last pickup from Tahiti to the strip is approx 11 pm and going from the strip back is around midnight for the return. It wasn't 24 hrs when we were there in Sept. It cost us $18 one night we took a cab back from the Mirage. Hope this info helps!,0
2680,Mark L,Feb 2016,"Times may change with demand; When I stayed there, the first pick up was at 10:05 AM and went until 11:05 PM every hour. 7 days a week, with an extra pick up on Friday & Saturday PM's, with a few special runs.",-1
2681,ThebazileP,Oct 2015,"The first time I was there in a February, it was heated. This last tin in October, I think they relied on the outside temperature to heat it. It was very comfortable both times!",0
2681,ianbosworth,Oct 2015,"no. but very quiet, and refreshing as the outside temp. was around 90 deg.",0
2681,newfie_penney,Oct 2015,yes the pool is heated - most times by the sun though.,0
2681,newfie_penney,Oct 2015,Yes it is - most times it is by the sun anyway,0
2681,Kathy Parrillo,Oct 2015,Not sure... Did not go to the pool,0
2681,Hostoco,Oct 2015,I am not sure if it is heated. I don't believe the pools are not open year round so it is best to call 702 440-6800 the front desk and find out.,0
2681,Ann B,Oct 2015,I was there in the summer and it was over 100 degrees outside and it had been for more than a month. When it is that hot the water temp for (almost) standing water is going to be very warm and of course the pool temp would be high as it would for all pools. It is only necessary to heat pools when the weather outside is chilly or cold. I don't know when you are going but if it is in the spring summer or autumn the pool temp will not be a factor. In fact you'll probably enjoy it more if the water temp was cooler so it can cool down your body temp. If you're concerned about t in the winter then it wold be a good idea to call the hotel directly.,0
2681,Opplbonnie,Oct 2015,The pool closest to the main lobby was heated when we were there last week and the hot tub was very warm.,0
2681,Theresa G,Oct 2015,I was there in May and it was heated at that time. Maybe they turn off heat during the summer?,0
2681,aperez77,Oct 2015,Not when we went in June. But there is a hot tub as well.,0
2681,Angela M,Jul 2016,No need to heat the pool in the summer. The sun heats the pool. The water is usually cooled in the summer or it would be too warm.,-1
2682,Ann B,Aug 2015,I'm sorry to say I do not have that information because with our resort plan we do not pay for the individual stay. It comes off our time share fees. And staying at Tahiti I usually bring some grandchildren so we opt for the 2 bedroom configuration which always includes a sofa bed in the adjoining living room. Why don't you call them directly and ask. You are allowed to go in place of the owners so don't let that frighten you about asking.,0
2682,Scienceonseven,Aug 2015,We paid $75 to upgrade for the entire week to meet the accommodations you have asked about.,0
2682,newfie_penney,Aug 2015,Sorry I was thinking about Tahiti Village. Not Tahiti Resort. Discard my answer. We stayed in a limited kitchen vs a studio - and I think if memory serves me well - it was about $40 difference in price. But you can email or call and they are pretty good in getting back to you with requests.,0
2682,newfie_penney,Aug 2015,Every unit already has a sofa bed. Moorea unit - king bed in Bedroom and sofa pull out in Living Room area. Bora Bora unit - king bed in Bedroom and sofa pull out in Living Room. Royal Tahitian - both units listed above. I am pretty sure they have roll away cots that they can add one more to your unit.,0
2683,Soleil Management,Aug 2015,"Hi, Marilyn. Thank you for choosing Tahiti! You will need to pick up your rental vehicle at the airport. Your son and daughter-in-law's arrival time is no problem. Someone will be at the front desk to check them in. We look forward to seeing you soon!",0

We look forward to seeing you.",0
2685,Ann B,Oct 2015,My husband and I are also seniors and it's one of the questions I always have when booking a hotel. Yes Tahiti certainly does have more than one elevator. However if you leave togged your car in the lots on the side or back there are a few steps (maybe 4 to six) to negotiate but a ramp is also there depending upon which is more accessible to you.,0
2685,Scienceonseven,Jul 2015,There are many first floor rooms. In fact I was very pregnant with twins during our stay and asked for a room on the first floor to make things easier and more accessible. There does happen to be an elevator. In fact the hot tub has a handicap lift as well. There was another customer who used it to transfer from her wheel chair into the hot tub.,0
2685,grcCamanoIsland,Jul 2015,"Yes, there are elevators. They are located at various places in the building.",0
2685,conativeGj,Jul 2015,Yes there are elevators conveniently located throughout the building. I would suggest calling the resort and asking for a room located fairly close to an elevator. Not right next because of noise. I like to stay in rooms with pool view. . get morning sun plus balcony is a nice place to enjoy coffee and listen to the birds.,0
2685,zookeeper_ca,Jul 2015,Yes there is an elevator. We were on the first floor so did not need to use it.,0
2686,Soleil Management,May 2015,"Hello, Deanna. Thank you for choosing Tahiti Vacation Club. We are sorry to hear about your foot. The good news is, we have three elevators here at Tahiti - one per building. We look forward to seeing you!",0

2690,ArthurItisinspades,Feb 2015,"My wife and I spent a week at the Tahiti the last week of October 2014, and we didn't notice any odor that was overwhelming or offensive. The condos were well equipped and clean, and the location, about a mile from the Strip, was just far enough to get you away from the crowded and extremely bust Strip. We have been in most of the hotels and casinos over the past 5 years, and a number still pump chemicals into the facilities to dampen the smoke smell. Some are stronger than others, and it's impossible to please everyone's sense of smell.",0

2693,Soleil Management,Jan 2015,"Hi, Dee-Roe 1. Thank you for your question. Tahiti Vacation Club does not have high-rise guest towers and therefore limited guest units with Strip views. We do have a few, however, and they are all deluxe suites. Frankly, they do not offer ideal Strip views if that's what's important to you. We would recommend staying on an upper floor, which would give you the best view. We would hasten to add that we do not guarantee specific room types. Guest units are assigned at check-in and based on availability. You can, however, request an upper-floor deluxe room with a Strip view on your reservation to give yourself the best chance of obtaining one. In case you're referring to Tahiti Village, our sister resort, we can tell you it does have high-rise guest towers with excellent Strip views. Again, no room guarantees but you can request a Strip view on your reservation. We hope this helps!",0
2694,Soleil Management,Nov 2014,"Hello, ohscrewit. As another responder mentioned, the lobby does not connect to the rooms. You can, however, request rooms that are in close proximity to the lobby.

Please call Yellow Scooters at 1-855-2-RIDE-ME for information. We look forward to your visit!",0
2694,californiadeb,Nov 2014,The lobby does not actually connect to the rooms. You have to go out and then into whatever building you are located in.,1
2694,Tana50,Nov 2014,"That would most likely depend upon where your room is located. I would recommend requesting a room on the ground floor for sure. I don't know if the Tahiti provides ""loaner"" wheelchairs but that would also be an option. We didn't really need to go to the lobby although they do provide a continental type breakfast but we had food in our room so we only went one time to check it out. Did eat the fruit. If you are driving consider a light weight type wheel chair. If flying perhaps the Tahiti can accommodate the need for a wheel chair.",1
2694,A Tripadvisor Member,Nov 2014,"It really depends on the location of your room. If you contact the hotel, I'm sure they can accommodate you. Give them advanced notice, though.",0
2694,Sissey1999,Nov 2014,Depends on where your to .you don't have to go through the lobby to get to your rooms for there are side doors where you park and then there are elevators. It's a great place to visit that's forsure and they are very accommodating too.,0
2694,Raroach,Nov 2014,Guess that depends on where the room is but I think it will be a little walk. But why does she have to go to the lobby? I went there to check in and out and to much more. Get a room near an exit to the parking lot.,0
2694,PSalemSutton,Nov 2014,There is a little walk depending on where your room is. I would specify that you need a room close to the lobby. We just took elevator down and walked outside and entered back lobby door.,0

If comparing to the newer Tahiti on LV boulveard I can only say that we prefer the ""older"" Tahiti on Tropicana Ave for several reasons.

The planes take off and land directly overhead. There are ear plugs provided on the nightstand. If you wear them, it might dampen the niose? They were uncomfortable and fell out of my ears. We woud never stay there again. If there's any way you can change your reservations go to the Embassy Suites Hilton on Swenson Avenue. It's close to the airport but quieter and so much nicer! You can walk or get a free shuttle to the strip with lots of places to eat. They also have the best made-to-order breakfast included.",0

2806,953pamlas,Mar 2019,The only good thing about this so called hotel (which is actually a time share property - owner‚Äôs dog peed up against our room door!)) is that it is very convenient for the monorail. Had to move rooms 3 times due to issues. The first room we were allocated was disgusting. Carpet was sticky.. Beds were on wooden boards with a broken wooden frame surrounding it and 2 weird looking canisters screwed to the floor behind the headboard on to the frame. They had the nerve to call it an upgrade - unbelievable!,1
2806,Rob,Feb 2019,Absolutely not. Do yourself a favor and stay on the strip. This place is a dump.,1

The food was sensational, but a bit over priced to be honest,. Overall,,, an amazing hotel, definitely be back",0
2806,Rob,Jun 2019,Absolutely not. Stay far away from the Westgate. Depending on your budget there are plenty of other places you should consider.,0
2806,peggy m,Mar 2019,"If you want to gamble-find a casino (most are very smoky) if not, find a non gaming place and you can choose what other casino's to visit.

2806,mantamoon,Feb 2019,"I would say, since it is your first time in Las Vegas, stay on the strip and enjoy the glitz and glam. The Westgate is just off the strip, but has easy access to the monorail. Just be careful where ever you decide to go, people are trying to get you buy this and that...just say NO. Go to the Peppermill for meals; it is just across the street from Circus-Circus.",0

Tell all of them NO Thank you and your trip will be much better. Find out if the heat is working, it was out all 3 days we were there and they did comp our last day stay but we were sick when we got home. If I had to stay anywhere again I may opt for the Bellagio or Caesars which was better situated where all we did was located.",0
2806,MichelleO1313,Feb 2019,Yeh pretty cool because the shuttle is right there. Takes you to the strip. 24 hours for 12 bux.,0
2806,Aaron Feld,Feb 2019,Depends on what you are looking for. It's just off the strip. The best thing to do is to figure out what it is that your are looking for within a hotel & then make a decision based on the amenities & close proximity to what you plan on doing.,0
2806,daremejclc,Feb 2019,"It‚Äôs a nice hotel to stay at if you want a quieter place away from the noise and hustle if the strip. It‚Äôs located off the strip, but not far from the other hotels and hot spots. We enjoyed it because it was nice to take a break from the hustle and bustle of the strip. The main strip is a 5 minute walk away, or you take take the wonderful tram that loads from the hotel.",0
2806,LISA L,Feb 2019,"The Westgate is a good hotel, for Nastalgia I liked it because Elvis lived there. But my first time I wanted to stay on the strip kinda in the middle so we stayed at Ballys and Paris. There is alot to do in both these hotels without even leaving the hotel. My favorite hotel is the Cromwell, it is a higher price though but its really nice. The Westin is great as well and then there is New York New York that's good as well. We also like the big names like Caesars, Belagio, Venetian, and Treasure Island. I've stayed at all of these. Any of these are great and where the action is. Circus Circus I won't stay at again, the beds were soooo uncomfortable. See a Cirque Du Soleil if you get a chance the O is good, Tarkana, Mystier, Michael Jackson, Beatles, and KA I've seen all of these and they all are great. Blue Man, Jabbawakeez and Celine Dion are good as well. Enjoy your self. I will be there this weekend again and I will be staying at the Westgate as I'm an owner.. Get the monorail day pass to go between hotels it will save you alot.",0

2806,CherieConley,Feb 2019,It is an ok place to stay. You will want to purchase a Monorail pass as it's not very close to the strip. The Flamingo is centrally located and very nice.,0

2806,Tristen W,Feb 2019,"Great hotel but not for first time experience. I would do Golden Nugget on Fremont. Great Hotel, great fun area.",0
2806,Jay L,Feb 2019,I would avoid this property no matter what they promise and if you do decide to stay there don't get sign up for the high pressured sales pitch to buy timeshare there. I would look into SLS which is across the street. Good luck and have fun.,0
2806,AndreaTerryTaylor,Feb 2019,"I think so. The pros are that you get the luxury feal for a great price, the resort has so much to offer, it‚Äôs gorgeous, it‚Äôs clean and beautifully maintained. You really get the Las Vegas feel without draining you bank account. The only con is that it‚Äôs a few blocks off the strip so you will either walk a lot or you‚Äôll have to figure out transportation like taxi, Uber, etc. Be prepared to walk and walk and walk some more! It‚Äôs a Vegas thing. We were warned and still came home with sore feet. Wear reasonable shoes if you want to walk the strip. The monorail and even the public bus system is great for getting where you want to go. We rented a car so we just drove everywhere and the Westgate has free parking, which is pretty rare. We had to drive out of town to the racetrack. They offered us a deal that if we paid $99 we can go back for a free three night stay and on the day we arrive we get $100 back. The only blackout date is New Year‚Äôs Eve and the catch is you have to listen to a time share presentation. That was a no brainer for us because we have no problem listening and then saying no. We‚Äôve stayed at some beautiful places by doing that. We‚Äôre heading back in a couple of months for our free vaca. Hope this answered your question. Have so much fun!!",-1
2808,Marc,Mar 2019,This is a question best for your customer support (for your ownership) or other timeshare websites like redweek or TUG (Timeshare Users Group). hope those referrals help!,0

2815,Sunshine0470,Dec 2018,"The resort fee for 3 nights was about $110. As for the drinks, I bought a beer in the hotel sports area and it cost $9.00 for 1 beer and it was a tiny bit bigger than a solo cup. We also ordered a Ruben sandwich (very good) with fries $16 and 2 small slices of pizza (not so appealing) $12 and a coke $6. So from that point on we just gambled enough to receive drinks & beers through the waitress & tipped them $2-3 and they stayed pretty consistent with making the rounds. Their breakfast buffet looked great and seemed reasonable, but didn't get to try it, because we got there too late they were already closing. We did use the Monorail and it was convenient. Wish we would have known about the shuttle. If and when we go again we plan on staying at the Westgate again.",0
2815,Tim C,Dec 2018,"As I recall the resort fee was $39 a day, but your booking agent should be able to confirm that.",0
2815,Dave C,Dec 2018,"As for drink prices they were ""average"" for Vegas! Best strategy is to play table card games where the drinks are free but just tip the waiter! We traded into the resort from Interval International and did not pay a resort fee. Note that the resort has a shuttle which is free to downtown. Also the ""Monorail"" is a good bargain if you buy the 24 hour pass as taxi rides are pricey. The Monorail comes directly to the hotel. Cheers",0

2820,Macombsboo,Nov 2018,"From my expierence, you can note your reservation all they want, and the hotel will not tell you that what you ask for can‚Äôt be done till your checking in, that‚Äôs how this 64 yr old woman wound up sleeping in a chair my first night there. My son was staying in our room for one night & I ask for a roll-a-way bed. Several times was told this would not be a fine but we would be charged 40.00 for a roll a way!! Which is an outrageous price. Our problem was opposite from yours, we got in at 7:30am, they didn‚Äôt have a room ready for us, we were on the concierge level, the extra person in the room would need to buy a voucher to take advantage of the lounge the voucher was only good for the day he purchased it, couldn‚Äôt get breakfast the next morning, extra charge for breakfast. Plus we could check in early, but that was another 30.00 fee! So if the day you check in on is after midnight, you could be charged the early check in fee. One last tip.. if your staying over a weekend & leaving Monday, you may find yourself in our position, Sunday after breakfast the concierge lounge may be closed without notice! We went down for lunch,it was dark, no coffee or water out, nothing!!! we ate all our meals there, and my daughter took advantage of their happy hour each day we stayed..but Sunday a day we had paid in the price of our room to use the lounge it was closed, after looking for over half an hour to ask what why it was closed, we were told, there weren‚Äôt enough people staying to keep it open!! I don‚Äôt care if we were the only people staying at that level, it should have been open!! To me we had a contract with the hotel, you pay X amount to stay at this level & we will provide these services for you. They didn‚Äôt offer vouchers to other restaurants, we were on our own!! This still angers me, since my son had to pay for a voucher to use our first day there, we had paid to use the lounge that day were out of luck & no one offered to compensate us for the waste of money the room upgrade cost us, this hotel is not close to any other hotels in Vegas so it was either pay to eat at one of their overpriced hotel restaurants or get a taxi or UBER to take us to & from another place to eat lunch & dinner!! This hotel is a buyer beware situation! Don‚Äôt even get me started on the resort fee that is an extra 40.00 everyday, that we had no intention of using, any of the facilities it offered, but we had to pay it..",1
2820,jodeemax,Nov 2018,"Hi Keitha, I would call the hotel before arrival and tell them your situation. I am sure they will work with you. I have had the same situation at a hotel in Laughlin, Nevada and it worked out perfectly. Good luck and enjoy Las Vegas.",1

(They do many stupid things like this. I don't think this hotel will be around long with their poor customer service; shutting down elevators; computers not being on during the night to even give you a room, a receipt, or anything; etc.) -They may not be able to assign you a room or program your keys, as their computers are shut off during the night as well.

2880,Shotsie W,Aug 2019,Stayed here several times and never have seen it in disarray. Always see people cleaning.,1
2881,Lisa W,Aug 2019,"You will initially request by phone. Be very clear about what you are requesting. Such as ""four coffee mugs' and 'four dinner plates', I know you would assume that when you say we also need 'bowls' 'cutlery' that would also receive four of everything. But it doesn't happen that way. Part of it is a language barrier, and part of it is clean inventory, and part of it is logistics. Vdara has responded to me as this is a HUGE frustration for us over the past 8-9 years we have stayed here. They assure me they are working on it. So, to set expectations, you will initially make the request by phone. Be very specific and very clear in what you want of each kitchen item. Why? We've had two dinner plates and four mugs delivered with no cutlery come to our door. Why? It may be clean, it may be in another area of the hotel, it may be a language barrier in understanding the intial request. So, be ready when that first person shows up with your request, have a list ready for that delivery person specifically showing the outstanding items. If there is a language barrier use sign language. Many times the workers come to our country and may or may not even be familiar with the utensils you are requesting, so writing it down helps them get it to someone on their team, and sign language gives them an idea. Then, just expect it, you will have a second delivery where you will STILL have items you requested not delivered, the person will tell you, ""....oh yes, we know.... we will get it here...' and they leave their shift, and your request unintentionally gets dropped. Frustrating yes. But just helping you be prepared. I hope your experience is smoother than our past dozen stays, and I'd suggest letting the front desk know if it takes three times to get your request filled, or if there's struggle in communication (language barrier). I just wanted you to be prepared for this hitch so you can enjoy the nice property.",1

2889,John Ange,Jun 2019,"The answer provided by sla2001 is spot on. The Aria is the Vdaras ‚Äúsister‚Äù property. You go out the front doors of the Vdara, walk the sidewalk for under 3 minutes ( yes I timed it) and boom...Aria doors. I could throw a football from the front of the Vdara and hit the doors of the Aria (well I could 30 years ago)ü§≠. The Bellagio is a longer walk, but it is all inside. Vdara lobby is connected to Bellagio via a long walk thru hallways of shopping and dining. I would personally go with the easiest and best parking structure. But all things being equal go with the Aria. You walk outside, but not nearly as far as Bellagio. Also check on cost. Because Vdara/Aria are basically the same property (they market Vdara as ‚ÄúThe Vdara at Aria‚Äù) there should be no additional cost for parking.

When I booked the joint it was listed as ‚ÄúThe Vdara at Aria‚Äù. We are the perfect couple to ask because on day one we booked a day-bed at the Vdara, and the same at Aria sky-pool the next day. In fact on day 2 we did a morning couples massage at Aria, which connects directly to sky pool. Plus you get an all-day pass to wander back and forth from spa to pool. To be honest I just enjoyed the experience at Vdara a tad more. I liked the daybed lots better, and found it to be more intimate and homey. The pool manager is a young lady named Dakota. Just amazing. Not enough space to tell you all she did for us, but one thing was her call to the Aria pool manager to tell him/her to make sure we had full sun day bed as we requested. The cocktail/ food servers were a tad slow, but looked great and super nice. Besides, the bar is only steps away if you need a quick drink. Hope that helps.",1
2890,frequentstaydude,Jun 2019,I was recently there this past week and the pool was closed completely @ Vdara and the fitness center a shadow of what it once was years ago with one bike for 1000 rooms and broken equipment they were trying to repair. To save money on staffing they closed early every night and asked the staff to go home earlier. They did however allow guests as a one time exception to use the pool at Aria due to the closure.I've heard the pool is disappointing by other reviewers @ Vdara but being I don't use a pool I cant comment myself,1
2890,Pauleen O,Jun 2019,No I‚Äôm afraid not üôÅthere is a pool at Vdara but it is quite small and beds pretty crushed together .. hope that helps üòÄ,1
2890,Trek21210203201,Jun 2019,Unfortunately I'm not sure either. I just used the pool at the Vdara and at the Bellagio. I had to separate stays though. I didn't stay at 1 and then go to the other school. I did however probably enjoy Bellagio's pool a little better. Since they all are MGM properties that's a good question.,0
2890,Delboy,Jun 2019,not sure we only used the pool in the vdara,0
2890,John Ange,Jun 2019,One caveat. We did book and pay for a day bed at both properties.,0

I dont know what to tell you about the extra charges. And obviously they know they have you over a barrel right now. Even after all the problems we had with our room I got a Sorry not Sorry email. Try Treasure Island next time.,1

2934,Denise B,Aug 2018,We have stayed there twice now and never had a problem. I didn't even know they allowed dogs. We feel it is the best hotel to stay at in Vegas.,1
2935,sanddollar1006,Jan 2019,"Thank you for the information. Yes, providing a small coffee maker would be extremely useful because the 1st thing I need in the morning is a cup of coffee, even if I go have a full breakfast somewhere else afterwards.",0
2935,Janice B,Aug 2018,"We took a French coffee press which worked great. You can order pans and place settings from house keeping and they bring them up right away. You can heat water on the two burner stove or in the microwave if you have a microwave safe dish. It worked out fine, but I think they should provide a small coffee maker.",0
2935,max70Sheffield,Aug 2018,"No and they want $20 a day to lend you one. We bought a mug and microwaved the water,",0
2935,playcold,Aug 2018,"Hello, they did not provide any kettle or coffee machine. To have a coffee machine there was a charge. Not sure if they would charge for a kettle too Hope it helps",0

2936,Grigg20,Aug 2018,We have stayed on the 30th and 47th floors. We couldn't hear traffic on the 47th floor and only very slightly on the 30th floor. Certainly not enough to cause us any disturbance.,0

2937,John N,Sep 2018,"Cameras cover every area you'll be walking and a Police presence is very likely, especially on weekends.",0
2937,rancherojack,Aug 2018,very safe,0
2937,linda j,Aug 2018,Yes it‚Äôs very safe you can walk to through the Ballegio or going the other way via the Aria. It‚Äôs always very busy during the day and evening. Wouldn‚Äôt like to comment on safety late at night,0
2937,aligoes2018,Aug 2018,Yes it is the strip is just a short walk away you can walk from the vdara or go through the aria,0
2937,FrancoisvH,Aug 2018,"Hi. Yes it is, you have different options and I believe the best one is to walk through the Aria which will get you on the strip without any problems. The other option is to take the side walk and bypass the Aria. We never felt unsafe walking to and from the strip.",0
2937,sbgb85,Aug 2018,Walk through the Aria to the strip,0
2937,theawesomedick,Aug 2018,"Yes, the easiest and safest way to reach the Strip is to walk through Bellagio. You can use the bridge from Vdara to Bellagio, the doors to the bridge are just right from Market Cafe in Vdara.",0
2937,jsrcancer1988,Aug 2018,"Yes it's safe, not a far walk from the hotel to the strip. If you find it to far you can always get a cab,uber or a lift.",0
2938,John N,Sep 2018,Expansion of building due to changes in temperature.,1
2939,raelenemae,Aug 2018,I believe it was the fountain view room :) it was very nice view with large windows. Basically one whole wall was a window!,0
2939,motojr,Jul 2018,It is the location to get a view of the Bellagio‚Äôs fountain. You get a little view from the city view. You are looking at more of the place across the I-15 and the mountains that direction.,0
2939,Peg R,Jul 2018,We did not have a view of the Bellagio fountain. We had a view of the Vdara pool and the circular drive connecting both Vdara and Aria. It was a very swank view and I would not feel the need to pay more for a different view.,-1
2940,bill t,Jul 2018,Yes.Vdara guests have exchange priveladges with Aria,2
2940,Derrrick,Jul 2018,Yes. I was actually there in February and Vdara‚Äôs pool wasn‚Äôt open yet so we were allowed to use the ones at Aria. It was a short walk and easy to get to.,2
2940,Georgina,May 2019,Is there a charge if staying at vdara to use aria facilities,0
2940,John N,Sep 2018,"Yes, one of the great aspects of staying at Vdara is the use of the ARIA ammenities, restaurants and options.",0
2940,chichi17,Aug 2018,"I emailed Vdara Guest Services and asked ""When staying at Vdara, can guests use the facilities at Aria?"" and this is the response I received, ""Vdara guests only have access to Vdara facilities complimentary as a valid room key is needed to access most pools and fitness facilities on the Las Vegas Strip.""",0
2940,Joan C,Jul 2018,Yes you can. They share amenities. We loved the view at Vdara!,0
2940,Carlton B,Jul 2018,"I didn't use the pool however anything that you couldn't get at the Vdara you were offered it at Aria. Meaning, we had two free buffets offered with the booking and it was fulfilled at Aria so I think they are sister hotels, Aria has the closet casino literally across the street.",0
2940,Rasim D,Oct 2018,you need to ask Aria,-1

2942,Doug K,Jun 2018,"There is a Walgreens right across the strip that will sell pretty much everything you need. They‚Äôve marked up everything about 50% more than normal,though.",2
2942,Sourav Bose,Jun 2018,There is a Convenience Store located in the Hotel Lobby where you will get almost everything you need but at a Higher Price . If you are looking for Liquor then you might need to hit the Strip which is barely a 4-5 min walk from the Hotel Lobby .,1
2942,mwkirch2000,Apr 2019,"It's a walk to the Walgreen's across the strip. Still, not a bad walk and getting some fresh air is good.",0

2944,rainbowinthesky1230,May 2018,"we brought our own coffee maker, since I like tea as well, so its cheaper just bring your own coffee maker",1
2945,bobambro,Jul 5,by all means do NOT check in on the app. I always speak directly to the desk person where you can smile and look someone in the eye and ask for a free upgrade if available. a 20 dollar bill between your credit card and drivers license usually will get you the high floor and a volcano strip view if you prefer.,1
2945,grouchy007,Jul 5,"Bring you own electric kettle or coffee pot, along with tea, coffee and coffee mate. Maybe even a toaster if you like toast. Nearby places to eat are lined off for breakfast all the time. Supplies are best bought at nearby Walgreens, not the convenience store in the hotel. Hotel is very clean, cleaning staff and concierge desk people were super.‚ù§Ô∏è",1
2945,Cliff P,Jul 5,"No real preference. Just know that there is no microwave or ‚Äúusable‚Äù refrigerator in the rooms. The pre-packaged food, and drinks in the ‚Äústocked‚Äù refrigerator, cost an ungodly amount of money, so don‚Äôt open anything you don‚Äôt want to take out a small loan to pay for. The bathtub/showers are antiquated and are on par with a Motel 6. Beware.",1
2945,asaph8,Jul 5,"We were at the Mirage for my daughters 21st birthday and had 2 queen rooms. My daughter and her friend were in one room and my wife and I in the other. We were nit very concerned with the rooms as we were barely in there. We were in the 23rd floor which those sets of elevators was the top floor. Being in 23 was nice as lots of people on the lower floors complained having to wait for the next elevator as it was full. Room for 2 people was fine however, if it‚Äôs more than that it will be tight. Hope this helps.",0
2946,Cliff P,Jul 5,"I think you can, if it‚Äôs small enough to fit in the elevators. I would call ahead.",0
2947,Aztoad,Jun 2022,"Unfortunately, no nightclub at the Mirage. The past several times I've been there they had live music at the Parlor Cocktail Lounge. Rhumbar also recently opened outside with a DJ.",2

2949,espinozagm74,Jul 4,The word is that MGM sold The Mirage and it will be demolished‚Ä¶ not sure when but I read at the end of summer sometime. The plan is to build a Hard Rock Hotel in its place. There are articles on this online.,0
2949,Wanderer50043990812,Jun 2022,"No, it is not",0
2949,C Y,Jun 2022,They are going to tear down the Volcano probably in Fall. but not the Mirage itself is my understanding. The Hardrock will go in where the Volcano is now.,0

2955,LoveTravel440064,May 2022,"Yes, everything is still there :) the dolphin and tiger garden are 25 dollars each I think. Volcano and waterfall area (the out front area) is free. Pool is free and has a really cool waterfall too :)",0
2955,Elizabeth G,May 2022,The dolphin and secret garden are there and are able to visit. The volcano wasn‚Äôt working when I was there about mid April.,0
2955,rbhammond2928,May 2022,The dolphins were there... don't know about the others,0
2955,Movingman143,May 2022,"Yes. But since it is fueled by natural gas, if it is windy, most of the water features are not operating. We were there for a week, it was windy and none of the strip water features were being seen.",0
2955,tonya w,May 2022,they were purchased by Richard Branson. The dolphins and tigers belong to the estate of Sigfried and Roy and did not transfer with the purchase. I am not sure when they are leaving. They are also tearing down the volcano. I am not sure when this will start. I did not find the staff knowledgeable so you may look on google.,0
2955,cedronavista,Apr 2022,Hi Yes they are all there. The grounds are beautiful too. There is also a giant fish tank that spans the whole wall behind the check out desk. There are lot of different beautiful fish in it. We saw many families staying at the hotel. Hope this helps. Have fun. MThayer,0
2956,sannycat,Apr 2022,"This is so different for every person and their individual finances. Renting a daybed is often $400-$800. And they are more private, sometimes secluded, more comfortable, come with better service...and most importantly you can come and go at your leisure without worrying if you will have a place when you come back.",2
2957,C Y,Jun 2022,I believe you can get a fridge for a charge. I doubt you will get microwave so I would bring your hotpot.,0
2958,Julia M,Mar 2022,Definitely used Uber to and from airport. The mirage did not have airport transportation. I would avoid the shuttles because they take forever dropping everyone off on the strip as well.,1
2958,Angel M,Jun 2022,The Mirage does NOT have an airport shuttle. You must find you own transportation to and from the airport.,0
2958,John H,May 2022,I dont know. I overheard a Guest checking out where the hotel had arranged airport transport but I don't know if there was a cost attached. Taxi fees to and from McCarron are capped at $29 for the Mirage.,0
2958,Paul H,Apr 2022,"yes they do,contact a host",0
2958,Davyboy75,Mar 2022,No. I used Lyft to and from the airport.,0

2958,Eric B,Mar 2022,No they don't. I used Uber it was like $25.,0
2958,Alice1754,Mar 2022,"I‚Äôm sure they provide limos for VIP‚Äôs but not regular customers and I think this is all of the casinos/hotels on the strip. There is very reliable & economical transportation right in front of the airport. There is a shuttle service which I believe is approximately $13 per person. You can also take a yellow cab, Uber and Lyft. It right outside baggage claim so not much walking. I took a cab, it was 2 of us with one bag each and I paid $27.00. Pretty reasonable & the cab driver was knowledgeable and friendly.",0
2958,rdub128,Mar 2022,"Yes I agree with previous answer. They have an excellent taxi service and it is never an issue. There may be a short line, but you should be in a taxi within five minutes. It‚Äôs right outside the front doors of the casino. The Mirage has limo service between the airport and hotel, but that is typically for VIPs. You would need to speak with the concierge desk or your host if you wanted to travel that way. It‚Äôs a pretty short cab ride to the airport.",0
2958,titwo,Mar 2022,HI! The hotel does not provide transfers from/to the airport but there is a very good taxi service at both ends and should not be an issue. It wasn't for me. Hope it is useful!,0
2958,Mindy M,Mar 2022,"I don‚Äôt believe that they do airport shuttles , they do have an uber / Lyft/ taxi drop off area. From the airport I think and uber is $25ish",0
2958,Ilona B,Mar 2022,I don‚Äôt believe the hotel does airport transfers. I personally used Uber to get to the hotel from airport and to go back. Some people use taxi. Once you arrive you can come up to the taxi and asked their price and compare it to Ubers price and go from there to see what‚Äôs cheaper for you. Hope it helps,0

Beer ,etc. We're on a healthy diet so we ate some of our lunches in our hotel room. Save a lil money.",0
2960,Patricia E,Mar 2022,"No, there are not. The small shops on the first floor sell bottled water, which I transferred to my own bottle to keep cold.

2960,Mary S,Mar 2022,"no water fill capabilities in room. We purchased gallon purified water at grocery stores to fill our bottles, we moved the coke cans around in the fridge to accommodate a leftover and we were charged for those cans the next day.

Also, unless you intend to purchase any of the snacks, make sure that you don‚Äôt even touch them. Their are magnetic and if you even touch them they will be charged to your room.

2960,Mazen H,Mar 2022,I did see any.,0
2960,Marie F,Mar 2022,I don't think there were. Vegas is bad at having water bottle fill stations anywhere but the airport. The Mirage probably wants you to buy the Fiji bottles they put in your room for $18 a pop. You could ask for a venti iced water from Starbucks with your coffee.,0
2960,Allen L,Mar 2022,No. Get bottle water from the casino. It's free..,0

2962,Travelin' Dan,Feb 2022,"I stayed there for New Year's just recently (it was absolutely freezing) and the adult pool was open (basically next to the entrance to Siegfried and Roy's Secret Garden). That said, I'd imagine the general pool would be open if it's listed on the website.",0
2962,Justin B,Jan 2022,The large pool is seasonal but with the hotel having been sold to Hard Rock. Is it even going to be open at all?? I would call the hotel and ask them questions directly since you are looking that far in advance,0
2963,LightPacker719135,Jan 2022,"Yes, easy and fast.",0
2964,omahadave2021,Dec 2021,I believe they do $100 day but I would just call and ask to be sure,2

2967,palmamichael,Dec 2021,I would not stay there. That is what we had. I would move across the street to the Venetian. It was absolutely beautiful there.,0
2968,rickybarnes2017,Nov 2021,"I can answer one of your questions: there is a fridge and it is stocked with what the hotel puts in it. If I recall correctly, there was not much room to place things in it. And the fridge has sensors if you move things.",2

2968,BrandonDY,Dec 2021,"The in room fridge is completely loaded with overpriced items. I was able to get a complimentary mini fridge brought to my room though. The pools are open year round.

Room availability was extremely limited",0
2968,sherrywoodland,Nov 2021,"I can only answer as to the refrigerator‚Ä¶you cannot use it. It is locked by front desk unless broken. Then if you touch items, you are charged. The lock was broken on my daughter‚Äôs and she tried to rearrange to fit in a leftover salad. We were charged $30 but they took it off after I called. I would have had no idea about those charges if a friend had not told us about those top items and refrigerator. If you just touch those items on the shelf above the refrigerator, they are on a weighted platform, and you will be charged. We worried all week about touching them. Watch your bill on the tv.",0

2968,KashiF,Nov 2021,"As already answered, do NOT touch the room‚Äôs fridge unless you want to over pay for what‚Äôs in there. You can buy a fairly cheap styrofoam cooler, and fill it with ice. As for the upgrade, you can YouTube on how to upgrade Tyrion location. They suggest a $20.00 tip to the front desk clerk when you check in. We did that, and received a strip, and volcano view. We had numerous problems where our original room smelled like pot that was over sprayed with room freshener, and got locked out of the elevator and our old and new room numerous times, there was a nice man who was monitoring the check in lines, and asked me what was wrong, I broke down and told him everything and he gave me a $50.00 resort credit. We don‚Äôt plan on going to Vegas anytime soon. Very disappointed in how outrageously expensive it is now. I remember back in the old days, when you could buy a steak an lobster dinner late at night in a nice restaurant for $7.99 a person. I‚Äôm happy that I was able to experience that in my lifetime.",0

As far as the pool goes, I would call the hotel directly.",0
2968,John H,Nov 2021,We usually stay in a suite and it has two Fridges one is empty for our use. Not sure about the other rooms and not sure about the pool being open in December. You could always request a refrigerator added to the room especially if you need it for medication.,0

They said there are refrigerators you can request to be brought to your room for personal items though. I have not been there in Dec. but I know at least some of the pools are closed for the season. It was actually chilly and breezy when we were there the beginning of Oct.",0
2968,John A,Nov 2021,"You cannot use your room refrigerator. RIDICULOUS! They will provide you with another one for $40.00/ day. More ridiculous. 2 eggs, 2 pasta of toast and homefries $22.00. I got it elsewhere for $11.00 Upgrading is easy, they love your money. The per night facilities charge is for ""courtesy wifi"" how is it courtesy if you have to pay for it? The pool closed early everyday so we never got to use it. If you bring a car you have to pay to park it. Better off staying at Sahara. It's cleaner, has both a refrigerator in the room and parking for free.",0

2968,Mommy40,Nov 2021,You can‚Äôt use the refrigerator because it‚Äôs stocked with items and if you move anything you get charged,0
2968,Nikki P,Nov 2021,I think the answer to the pool question is that it‚Äôs dependent on the weather. In my experience the resort tower rooms have refrigerators for hotel use only unless you have the need for a fridge for medical reasons.,0
2968,aljean68,Nov 2021,"Yes there is fridge with lots of overprice things inside! I think most hotel are going away from having fridges for your use.I think the mirages pool is closed in december,I tryed to make reservations for December they were booked from the 8th-14th,so they comped me to the Luxor!.hope you have fun!",0

2968,samel92021,Nov 2021,No you should not use the refrigerator you normally can upgrade easy and some pools are open till January,0

2968,CMKC1981,Nov 2021,My October room‚Äôs mini fridge was just a mini-bar for purchase protected by weight sensors - and warned that if u stored anything in it - it‚Äôs a $50 re-stocking fee. Can‚Äôt help with Dec pool question - was open in early Oct tho.,0
2968,John M,Nov 2021,The room fridge is stocked with expensive items You move them you bought them. Fridge is useless for own personal use. The hotel is very run down. Advise staying elsewhere!!!,0
2968,KAVesq,Nov 2021,I think that the refrigerators are for the mini-bar only. Upgrades depend on room availability. I'm not sure the pool schedule in winter. It could be weather dependent?,0
2968,Ebobee,Nov 2021,Most places will empty the frig if you ask them too.,0
2968,larry529,Nov 2021,"You can request another fridge, for $35 (I think) pretty night. Pool is iffy, and the hours very according to the whim of the day. Upgrade is based on availability.",0
2968,omahadave2021,Nov 2021,Pools open year round. Not hard to upgrade if avail and you are willing to pay. Any room is decent. Upgrades will usually involve view choices,0
2968,John B,Nov 2021,"Hello there, unfortunately you won‚Äôt be able to bring outside purchases and put them in their fridge since it does have their overly priced items. My advise don‚Äôt move any item in the fridge and even on top of it on the counter because they are sneaky like that. As far as pools being open in December ask the front desk when you check in. And last for upgrading all depends when you check in because if you call right now and if their suites or anything more than what you got is all booked then they‚Äôll tell you to wait until you check in because someone may of cancelled.",0
2968,omahadave2021,Nov 2021,Loaded with overpriced stuff and dont remove! They MAY have fridges upon request from housekeeping,0

2968,Randi H,Nov 2021,They didn't upgrade. They were to busy. Yes expensive frig stuff.. couldn't empty out. Don't know about pools were there in the summer. So crowded could not get lounge chair unless u paid to reserve. Winter might b different,0
2968,Mitch H,Nov 2021,You cannot use the fridge. If you touch anything in there it will trigger a charge. I tried to upgrade this time and they had no availability,0
2969,BrandonDY,Dec 2021,Some of the rooms have been recently renovated. Not all of them are though. I got a Tower King on the 25th floor. It was very nice and recently renovated. On the same trip my cousin got a regular King Room on the second floor that had not been renovated yet.,0
2969,Granny53214,Oct 2021,I first went to the Mirage maybe twenty to eighteen years ago. I believe the rooms have been updated. I hope this helps.,0
2969,virginia w,Oct 2021,Perhaps it depends on the room type you get but we were in a Resort Two Queens and my nephew and his wife were in a Resort King room which are the least expensive rooms. These rooms were ok but needed updating and had problems. We had to move a couple of times. The first room had a sopping wet rug from a leak in the AC. The second room had a dripping sound in the bathroom which was behind the wall coming from a leak in an upper floor and was never rectified. Maybe it's hit or miss or worth getting the more expensive rooms. I'm not sure what the answer is but I believe the rooms need attention.,0
2969,Gen4travel,Oct 2021,Rooms are nice and modern. Unsure of last renovations,0
2969,Allen L,Oct 2021,Don't know when it was last innovated. But the room is large and very nice.,0
2969,joedavidson1970,Oct 2021,The rooms are excellent!!! You won‚Äôt be disappointed,0
2970,Maria B,Oct 2021,Best thing would be to call MIRAGE directly and speak to the concierge. Good luck!,2

2972,TomFleming,Sep 2021,I don't often iron my clothes - I travel with a bottle of Downey Wrinkle Release so I can avoid the iron. I just steam using the steam from the shower in a small bathroom. There was an iron and board in the room though.,0
2972,Christopher P,Sep 2021,"no just irons. they may have in the 1000+ night rooms, but not in standard or regular suits",0
2972,gcorselli,Sep 2021,They have standard irons in all rooms in the closet,0
2972,dottied232,Sep 2021,There are no steamers in the suites. Just irons. Room service will do it tho. I'm sure there is a fee.,0
2972,Maia B,Sep 2021,"I did not see a steamer - as a previous respondent indicated, there is an iron in the room. I am not sure what you can request, but if you have an issue with mold, the answer is to avoid being in a room with it at all costs. It seems pretty systemic though. I saw another review where a lady forced housekeeping to change the HVAC filters in front of her. I'd just rather not have to bother. Maybe you could ask if they could upgrade you to a Stay Well room? Might have better odds. Good Luck",0
2972,Steve V,Sep 2021,"To my knowledge, there is an iron in the room which could possibly be used as steamer, but no actual steamer unit. Not sure if housekeeping has those.",0
2972,omahadave2021,Sep 2021,Call the concierge for a definitive answer. There is a walgreens across street if you want to buy one,0
2972,Dar P,Sep 2021,"If you mean a clothes steamer, no there is not.",0
2972,Jamie D,Sep 2021,"There is an iron and ironing board in the room, but no steamers. I am not sure if you can request one or not.",0
2972,John M,Sep 2021,An iron. May want to call them.,0
2972,Robert D,Sep 2021,"No steamer in the room. Might be able to get one from the hotel. Depending on your needs, The hotel has reasonable laundry and dry cleaning services. I was there for two weeks and used both with satisfying results.",-1
2973,BrandonDY,Dec 2021,yes!,0
2974,BrandonDY,Dec 2021,When I went in November they had both available. The ones closer to the pools you had to pay extra for but the ones farther away were no extra charge. They also had a small pool off to the side that was VIP that you could pay for. No one was doing that though as there were plenty of chairs.,0
2975,BrandonDY,Dec 2021,There are cabanas around the perimeter that you can rent. There were plenty of lounger chairs around the pool that didn't require an extra fee. If you want privacy and shade though you have to rent a cabana.,0
2975,Tine743,Aug 2021,Free seating is not shaded. You need to pay for the day beds and umbrellas. I believe you can walk up to purchase but can also make a reservation for them.,0
2975,TerryTom2119,Aug 2021,It rained the June days we were there‚Ä¶. No pool time.,0
2975,Amy B,Aug 2021,"The daybeds are all reserved seating, and the umbrellas require a chair reservation. The free seating is not shaded.",0
2975,Steve V,Aug 2021,"From my experience, many of the seats were for paid reservations, which you can see a map on the MGM website. I do believe there is a charge for any umbrella use.",0
2975,Angelbond7,Aug 2021,"When we were there this past July, there were some lounge chairs with umbrellas on the far side of the pool that were for reserved. I don‚Äôt know about the parasols though.",0

2976,333patg,Aug 2021,"The Mirage and all of the MGM properties are being very strict with the mask mandate (which we were thrilled about) - lots of people, tight quarters. They have security everywhere reminding people to wear their masks and handing out free ones to anyone lacking a face covering. Masks were not required at the pool or while eating and drinking.",0
2976,Robert D,Aug 2021,The mask mandate is in effect for all inside activities unless you are eating or drinking... so plan to keep your favorite beverage close by. Outside and at the pool masks are not required. There are some shows starting to reopen.,0
2976,90dianam123456,Aug 2021,"Hi there. We had to wear masks inside everywhere but not outside on the strip or by the pool. The mirage did supply masks as well if needed. I suspect other hotels would have come the same. We did make reservations but not because of Covid. If we didn‚Äôt, there was usually a wait. There was no limited capacity in any establishments when we were there‚Ä¶. Places were packed full. A suggestion of mine would be to look into things ahead of time and make reservations if you can! Enjoy your trip.",0
2976,Venita D,Aug 2021,No you don‚Äôt have to wear a mask by the pool but if you want to sit by the pool you have to reserve a seat with the mirage. And you have to wear a mask while walking through the hotel.,0
2976,creedsm0m,Aug 2021,"Yes, they are requiring mask mandate within the Mirage with the exception of outdoor activities pools,outdoor jacuzzis etc‚Ä¶. While we were there during our stay restaurants within the hotel we‚Äôre requiring reservations that were anywhere from a half an hour to a couple of hours it depended on the time of day. If you were at the machines other than drinking your chosen beverage mask on. All of the MLife properties it is posted on their website. The other hotels and casinos that we went into the same standards with the mask mandate.",0

2976,NicPe1985,Aug 2021,"We were just there in July and my husband and I didn't wear a mask anywhere. They had signs put up that said you don't have to wear a mask if you're fully vaccinated but that it's recommended. No one at the pool was wearing a mask. If you're going on a holiday weekend you should make reservations for your food venues, otherwise you may be waiting hours to get table",0
2976,elroycasey,Aug 2021,Things are as usual. Except you have to wear mask inside at all times.,0

2977,HarrysWife,Jul 2021,"We were there in late June and it was the honor system‚Ä¶if you‚Äôre vaccinated you could go maskless. We wore our masks when in any property. The tables had removed one chair so it was roomier but not socially distanced. They had some hand sanitizer at each table. The cheaper tables were packed but you could easily get seats at the more expensive ones. We were definitely in the minority wearing our masks. We won‚Äôt go back until things are in better shape with the pandemic. Besides the property not being fully staffed which caused service issues, there was not a feeling of safety at all.",2

I also had to ask them to clean again as there were crumps behind the table. Also if you are not staying a week you still have to pay the cleaning fee. Which is ridiculous. If you are a Hilton member/owner you get the really nice ones. To me it shouldn't matter, but it does there. Hope this helps you",0

The location to amenities for me is always key and really left a bad taste in my mouth to purchasing a full time share package. Service in the grocery store on main level was slow. Concierge was good. Trying one of their New York locations next month",0
3092,MRJ,Aug 2019,The hotel rooms are quite updated and I found them to be excellent. We of course stayed in the hotel portion and not in the RCI rooms. The tower to the left of the entrance are the RCI rooms while the hotel tower is on the right when facing the entrance,0

My husband and I are in our mid-50's, but it excellent physical condition and health. We're extremely active. We enjoyed walking from the hotel to the strip, but this was in early spring. However, in the heat of summer I wouldn't want to walk it regardless of how good of shape we are in. In the summer wear a hat, have lots of water. I'd even suggest take an umbrella with you wherever you go it's instant shade. Then a light sweater because it's always cold in the hotels. Hope this helps. Enjoy!",0

I thought Vegas was a adult playground not a kids playground! As far as my room, I was there in June 2021 and my room was fine! It was clean, very large corner room, great views, smelled good, bathroom was clean and large, but it was a long walk from the elevator. I just could‚Äôve done without all the noise from the roller coaster, noise from the pool, all the children, and the lack of attention the parents gave to there children, especially at the pool and jacuzzi.

3217,Alex G,Oct 2019,No they do not have any coffee makers in the rooms I have stayed in there. But if you skip the Starbucks line and go strait to the round bar (every casino has it) for about $2.50 to $3.00 plus a buck for a tip goes a long way in Vegas you get just as good of coffee without the long line for the $9.00 small they charge in a casino.,0

3226,Peter K,Aug 2019,"The NYNY has a Cirque show as its headline act, Zumanity I believe. At the casino level are restaurants and a couple of pubs that have entertainment. As for comedy shows there are at least a dozen within walking distance from the hotel. Prices vary but comedy acts are usually fairly cheap in comparison. Tickets can be purchased at the kiosks all over Vegas at discount prices.",1
3226,Norma F,Aug 2019,It has Zumanity from Cirque du Soleil though as the hotel is very very well located I prefered to go to other of the 6 cirque du soleil in Vegas. It is also amazing the roller coaster with discount for guests.,1

3228,M D,Aug 2019,No! If you are a guest at the hotel you pay a daily resort fee added on top of what you paid for the room. That fee allows you to use the pool and fitness area.,0
3229,Vanila I,Jul 2019,Yes. You can drop yr luggages at the hotel. Then I can rock b roll yr day. ü•≥ü•≥,1
3230,truthhonestA1,Aug 2019,Just got back Yes they charge the $100 and resort fees ( which they never use to ) The $30 credit is something that is charge to the room. Best thing we did was go to a breakfast place or Starbucks was an easy way to use up the credit. We grabbed snacks water and drinks They do need your id the $30 excludes the tip so be prepared. If you do it other places it hard to split the bill and do $30 to the room and the rest to pay. Also the restaurants are the greatest and you may not be in that location to use up the credit.,0

It is a ride share service that makes several stops at different hotels on the strip. Bonus- NewYork NewYork is one of the first few stops. When you arrive at the hotel, you must go to the concierge desk and reserve your time slot for your return ride to the airport in order for your pass to be valid.",4
3231,Jackie,Jul 2019,There isn‚Äôt a shuttle for the hotel. I always use Uber and if you‚Äôre not in a hurry you can ride share with Uber. Ride share will pickup a couple of people and you split the fare. I did use a taxi my 1st time there and boy was that expensive.,1
3231,andrewwS3389DT,Jul 2019,Hi. No there wasn‚Äôt. It was taxi or Uber. We used cabs which was $25. There is a free shuttle bus to the car rental place if your hiring a car though from the airport,1
3231,estupinan88,Jul 2019,There are shuttle service but not for free though. I think they now cost $8-10 per person. If i were you i would take a uber they cost from 13-17 depending on location. What ever you do dont take a taxi they will charge you so much its unreal. Last time they charged me like 37 from circus circus to airport(mcclaren) have fun hope this helps,1

3251,Rick S,Apr 2022,It was my understanding that before the pandemic there was a multi hotel shuttle that handled to transportation to and from for a number of hotels. Apparently it has been disbanded for obvious of maybe unobvious reasons ($). Our visit in Sept.2021 no shuttle service was available flat rate taxis are reasonable but can't compare with what was once free. Ask your drive how much either before of upon entering his/her vehicle most destinations are in thee area of $25.00. With the price of a rental now days the rates more than reasonable.,0
3251,b168,Apr 2022,"I don't think they have a hotel shuttle, but nowadays, the cabs are cheap b/c they have a fixed rate of $20-27. The prices are posted on the wall outside baggage claim. It's a huge sign, you cannot miss it. So depending on which group a strip hotel resides, will determine your cab ride cost. I think the cab ride was either $25 or $27 for Palazzo when we took it. Hope this helps.",0
3252,Pat V,Apr 2022,You have free breakfast at the prestige lounge. It used to be a small buffet with cold and hot items. Past covid it is now a limited choice: pastries and one wrapped hot item which is very greasy.,0

3252,CarolinaNurse323,Apr 2022,Thanks for your question but we selected the breakfast option for our suite and due to Covid at that time it was served up in a carry out bag to go located in one of their reception rooms. I didn't like the cold hard boiled eggs so we ended up going to the Starbucks downstairs from the elevators and bought some pastries with coffee.,0
3253,Shelley T,Apr 2022,"There are many pools to choose from at the Palazzo/Venetian. You can even rent a little poolside cabana for extra privacy. Early mornings are usually better than afternoons, also not as hot.",2

3253,Jim K,Apr 2022,"During Winter break for some folks, I visited the pool area on one afternoon it was moderately crowded, the pool was dense with people. Seating near the pool was hard to find if you wanted more than two lounges together. Towel were thrown across unoccupied chairs I guess to indicate they were taken. I'm not sure I would have found a quite place. If you plan on visiting the Palazzo when schools are in session it may be a different story.",1
3253,Barbara R Hartman,Apr 2022,"We only went to the pool once and you can find lounge chairs that are kinda back away from the crowded area. I really don't know if there is any other area. There is a little cabana bar, that has some different drinks that are really good. Hope this is helpful.",1
3253,mwalde,Apr 2022,"Yes, my recommendation would be to go to the pool at opening (typically around the 8am hour), head to the left toward the Venetian, and you‚Äôll find 2 smaller pools (still part of the Palazzo complex), that get more sun than the main pool does. Perfect place to lounge, and can even do some light lap swimming.",1
3253,buzzard6,Apr 2022,"I'm sorry. Didn't go in pool area. As far as quietness, it is more of a mature crowd. Peaceful. Thanks",1
3253,Mike G,Apr 2022,"Yes, the palazzo pool has good sunlight and is less rowdy than other places on the strip. The Venetian is a bit more activity and the crowd is definitely younger and louder.

3253,Jon M,Apr 2022,"They have several, but it depends on the time of the year if they will be open. Sadly, at Thanksgiving I think only one was open but it was too cold and only kids were in it.",1
3253,Jenny A,Apr 2022,"I usually swim in the morning and it is quiet and less crowded. However, I don't know about summer time because I don't go to Vegas during summer months due to the high heat. Palazzo has more than one pool, I am sure you can find one that is quiet and less crowd.",1
3253,Pamela Y,Apr 2022,We were there for 4 days last week. The pools are not rowdy. One of the pools was closed and it was the one with the most sun. The sun is good in the afternoons at all pools I think.,1
3253,Eric B,Apr 2022,"So, The Palazzo and Venetian each have a series of pools running from south to north. The earliest sun will hit the most southern Venetian pools at around 9 am. In the early afternoon, about 2pm, the most northern Palazzo Pools will have direct sun. All pools are beautiful; the Venetian pools seem to be a bit louder and have a younger crowd, while the Palazzo pools seem to cater to a more mature crowd. So you may move freely between both sets of pools, and you may have direct sunshine from early in the morning to late in the day - if you follow the pools from south to north throughout your day.",1

3285,SoCA OC,Dec 2020,I hope not,0
3287,Shelli M,Dec 2020,I would think they are not. Most pools are not open in December (and especially with reduced capacity due to Covid). I know Circa has a heated pool that is open. I would call the hotel.,0
3288,Sightseer64685124027,Nov 2020,Yes it will be open but will be under winter hours (closing at 4 instead of 6). Average temp in March is a high of 60 so a bit chilly for swimming!,1

3294,rodhiro,Mar 2020,"That charge normally takes 3 to 5 business days on my credit card to be removed. I'm not actually charged the amount. It shows up as pending on my account but It's mainly due to the bank taking that time to process the transaction or reverse the charge. If you don't see a change in a week definitely contact the hotel and your bank. By the way, it always may me a little uneasy when I see that charge after I've checked out but I've never been charged.",0
3294,Grilyn S,Mar 2020,It should be the same day. The hotel will only charge you the resort fee and if you go to their restaurant and charge that to your room. And also you will see the charges the day you checked out. For us they send me the e-mail and also I asked them to print our bill. I hope these will help you. If you still concern you can call the hotel.,0
3294,lucycan,Mar 2020,Good question. They pre authorized the same $600 for my week stay last week. It looks like its still on there but its not an actual charge. Just a pre-auth. Your CC should be able to tell you that.,0

The cabanas are beautiful, but expensive (go to their website, Pools & Cabanas, for a breakdown based on size of cabana). The pool at The Palazzo has very definite shady areas (sun behind the hotel building) and sunny areas so depending upon what time you want to be out there pick your spot accordingly. When I was there some people were 'reserving' (with their towels) two different spots so as to have sun all day (I personally abhor that sort of practice but we won't get into that!). The pools are absolutely gorgeous at both hotels, both with quite a different vibe - I found The Palazzo quieter.",1

3320,janet g,May 2019,They are both similar. I think palazzo May be smaller and a little quieter in public areas. The shops and canals at Venetian bring in a lot of people. The rooms at both are nice and quiet. We almost always stay at one or the other. We prefer the casino at palazzo bc it doesn‚Äôt seem as crowded.,2

In some instances they may have more of one room opened than another so they may just switch you over. If the first person you speak to does not sound so helpful, hang up and call again or better yet ask for a supervisor. Let me know how it goes.",2
3323,Irene S,May 2019,We tended just to use the Palazzo ones. Nice bar and restaurant there. Lots of beds and the towels are free. Free water too. Don‚Äôt forget your ID if you want alcohol at the bar as they ID you. Being from the UK we were not expecting that especially as we are so clearly over 21 as we have children over 30 years of age. There is a bag search at the pool entrance to ensure you haven‚Äôt got any glass with you. Sadly the nightclub isn‚Äôt free. You will have a great time. Enjoy,1

3326,Chris H,May 2019,"The hotel charges a $45 per day, per room ""resort fee"" which allows you use of the various pools. When we were there last month, we noticed people begin putting towel, books, sun screen, etc on the chairs as early as 8:00 AM to save the chairs. Many of these chairs were not used until way after breakfast. Also, note that the Venetian pool deck is under renovation until Summer of 2019 and guests from the next door, sister hotel are allowed to use the pools at the Palazzo during this time. Also, Fri thru Sunday they are starting a ""club"" in their pools with club music, drinks and food. In my opinion, not really a place for kids and there were mostly ""adults""",1
3326,katie l,May 2019,We were there at the end of April and they had 2 pools under construction but I'd imagine they'd be done by August. I did not see any specific Adults Only pools but the center pool is definitely the busier so probably more kids. One thing i noticed that i didn't like is the pool and chairs didnt get sun until about 12/1 so could be chilly until then.,0
3326,JulesMill,May 2019,They have two ‚Äòrelax‚Äô pools at the Palazzo but not sure if they are for adults only. May be worth checking with them directly.,0

3340,arnesalkin,Feb 2019,The issue is not about bringing children but what to do with children. Essentially every Las Vegas hotel is a hotel with a place to sleep. Many of the rooms are far better than standard rooms across the country. Children under 21 are not permitted nor welcomed in the casinos. This is where the major public facilities are located. The family pool areas are nice in season but young children tend to disturb hung over people who are trying to nap at the pool. Food in the resorts is geared to more exotic tastes but there are children's menus. Eating on a young child's schedule makes getting into these restaurants easier. Las Vegas is an adult Disney. There are many better places to consider before bringing young children to this hotel or any Las Vegas resort.,0
3340,NayJay,Feb 2019,"I brought my 5 year old and I would NOT recommend it. There really isn't anything kid friendly at the resort. He did have fun, just because of the experience and we ate out a lot. But other than that we didn't do anything child or family oriented.",0
3340,bags52,Feb 2019,yes but more suitable hotels,0
3340,Quest657828,Feb 2019,"Yes, I personally wouldn‚Äôt take a child to the Vegas Strip period. There are hotels that have fun activities for children but aside from swimming in the pools this hotel caters to adults.",0
3340,Joseph S,Feb 2019,Yes children are very welcome. There are certain restrictions on the Prestiege level and it will be explained to you when arrive there to check on.,0
3340,Just A Girl Who Travels ALOT,Feb 2019,Absolutely,0
3340,Jeffrey E,Feb 2019,"Yes, I see no reason at why not. As Nat K said above, plenty of options accommodation wise. The children will love the Gondolas as they moive slowly down the ""grand canal"" that winds throught the restaurant ""street"" between the Palazzo and the Venitian next door. I'm sure you will find it most confortable and lots of fun,",0
3340,Nat K,Feb 2019,"Depending on the age of the kids, you can share beds Eg Queen Bella x2 beds Or get two adjoining rooms with connecting doors. Or request at cot",0
3341,Barbara O,Feb 2019,Yes,0
3341,Blackdiamond71,Feb 2019,Absolutely- it‚Äôs not an adults only venue and there were plenty of families while we were there.,0

3341,Wptatl,Feb 2019,Yes . I'd check the room for two queen beds. They can go into casino but can't gamble. There were children around when I was there.,0

3342,Natalie G,Feb 2019,"Hello! As of January 1st, the resort fee is added to all room charges and is no longer included in the prestige rate. I don‚Äôt know of any other discounts! Have a fun trip!",1
3342,Kenneth C,Feb 2019,"I'm not sure specifically about the prestige upgrade. But in my experience at the Venetian, resort fees are added at check in. They block off a certain amount on your credit card for incidentals and the resort fees are taken out of whatever refund you are issued. As for offers, they are running a 20% off special right now I've been getting emails for (code jea20s) not sure if that got applied when you booked or not. Couldn't hurt to ask.",1
3342,Barbara O,Feb 2019,"I am not sure. But, you don‚Äôt need the resort fee if you are not going to use the WiFi, gym ect. In the 3 times I have stayed here I only used the resort fee once. To use the gym. Which we used daily. It was worth it. There is always great deals in Vegas to help with cost. Just keep goggle handy and ask for deals. One way to cut cost is the Walgreens down stairs. Cheap bottle water, snacks, and other great things! If your flying in use the shuttles or Uber. Taxi can be spending. Be willing to walk (a lot).",1
3343,VitorMartinsBR,Jan 2019,"Yes, available in all floors but do not expect to use the mini fridge. There is no space and if you remove something it will be billed immediately.",1
3344,All-Around-Nice-Guy,Jan 2019,"I'm not sure about the ""official"" rules but I can share my own experience as a Spire Elite member. If you book through a third party such as Hotwire or Priceline where you don't know the name of the hotel before you book, you will receive no points for that stay at an IHG hotel. (If I can't get a decent rate directly from IHG, I often use a Hotwire/Priceline No Name booking.) However, depending on the front desk staff at the hotel, they still honor my IHG status with room upgrades, drink coupons, etc.This is particularly true for hotels where I stay often.",1
3344,S1thlord,Jan 2019,There are also agents available to chat.,0
3344,Cobi00,Jan 2019,"Sorry, don't know. I'd just call IHG or the hotel front desk and ask.",0

3346,Ivy C,Jun 2022,It is free to guests. Nice size pool,0
3346,jebauser,Jun 2022,I did not use,0
3346,Cousin T,Jun 2022,It's the regular room rate plus the upgrade (depends on when you go - we have paid between 200 and 400). We try to book one of these when we are traveling with several people. There are only 5 of these rooms - and they lose the sun quickly in the afternoon). But they are great :),0

3348,jebauser,Aug 2021,We like the north tower on the higher floors. The noise on Fremont street is not an issue for us as we are up till early morning anyway. If you are on the west side of the north towers you do not hear anything anyway,0
3348,Stan C,Aug 2021,North Tower - upper floor. Farther from Freemont Street. Less noise and lights. Basic room is fine. Nothing fancy but it's all you really need.,0

If you are savvy with city buses, that's your best bet to get to the hotel, a 24 hour city bus pass is only $8 and you can ride as much as you want.

I think the party pools would be more likely in the warmer weather. For me personally, I preferred The Encore as it's slightly smaller than The Wynn and the crowds seem to be in The Wynn's casino. It's like people don't want to take the extra walk to The Encore, which is fine by me ! We were on the 19th floor, it is a non-smoking floor which I had asked for, we truly could not hear any noise from the clubs and we didn't hear any noise from other rooms on the floor.

3493,mcbrandt2018,Aug 2018,"Re, ""is the hotel kid friendly?"" In the pool area, maybe.

Anyways, we got a Encore European pool standard cabana which was on the second level (you had a short flight of stairs down to the pool level, but there were two chaise lounges that were in the sun from about lunchtime until late afternoon. The fridge being stocked with gatorades and waters and soft drinks and the complementary fruit plate were very welcome with the vegas sun and heat. Also the misting system made laying in the sun less oppressively hot. The lower level cabanas are never in the sun. I would highly recommend getting the cabana but at the cabana itself only 2 people will be able to lay in the sun at a time.

3516,C K,Nov 2017,"The men‚Äôs spa and women‚Äôs spa are pretty much identical is what my understanding is from my wife as I have only used the men‚Äôs but she love‚Äôs the women‚Äôs spa. We have both only used the Encore spa. When you enter the spa there‚Äôs a nice sitting area with couches and water and it‚Äôs fairly dark and quiet and you can use your cell phone in there. Just past that there is a locker room where you get a locker for which you set a pin code and you must leave your phone in there before using the rest of the facility. They give you a big plush robe and rubber slippers to use. Everything from the locker room on is nudity optional. Some of the men go naked some wear trunks. My wife has said most of the women are in swimming attire in the woman‚Äôs side. There‚Äôs a steam room, a dry sauna and then a large wet area where there are a bank of deluge style showers with shower heads in the side and above you. There are two large jacuzzi style tubs that could easily holy 10 plus people each. Then there are two cold plunge pools one at I think 75 and one at 65 I think (don‚Äôt quote me on those temps) Then there are several heated stone chaise style chairs to relax in. There is also a large shower room with I think 16 private and individual showers that are identical to the showers in the rooms. There are also full bathroom facilities and sinks/vanities. There are plenty of towels readily available everywhere as well as cold water soaked wash cloths and places to put them. The men‚Äôs bathroom has mouthwash and razors and shaving cream and hair gel etc. the showers have body wash, conditioners shampoo are all molten brown products. There is a separate waiting room for treatments with nice comfy chairs. The massage rooms are beautiful with a beautiful walkway between rooms. Any spa treatment comes with a complementary day pass for the facilities from open to closing time. The $40 spa pass fee is well worth it to relax and rejuvenate even if you don‚Äôt get a treatment. As I said, my wife has described the facilities as being exactly the same. There‚Äôs tons of complementary water available and cold cucumber slices etc.",3

The Tower Suites are kinda like a hotel within a hotel at the Encore with its own entrance, separate check-in and concierge, and your choice of Strip and off-Strip views. I requested an off-Strip view because those suites tend to be quieter at night. I hear that those with a Strip view may be less quiet late at night/early in the morning due to the outdoor beach club and its ""beats"" emanating from below, so with the Strip view there may be a tradeoff if that matters to you.",0

But, there are drinks full in the freezer that you need to pay to drink......no spaces for your personal stuffs. You can still ask the additional freezer to install for your stay. But they will charge you daily for the additional freezer. 2. Yes, this hotel offers the special welcoming set-up upon your request. But I am not sure if it is complimentary or not. 3. All the swimming pools at the main street hotels of La Vegas usually close at 06 pm or 07 pm for the general hotel guest user. After this hour some of the hotels have the personal events or club party or concert at pool, which means there is no way to use the pool at night......sorry.....

No other facilities were mentioned. We had two rooms and only paid it for 1 as we only had 3 devices. The person in the room who did not pay the fee didn't appear to be restricted in any other way and could use the poool.

There's also a fee for that area, cabanas are probably more expensive. The ones at Wynn have a mini fridge and the ones we had on the lower level had an enclosed area if we needed to get out of the sun which was nice.

There's the 21 and over swimming pool which is really relaxing. Spa is beautiful and restaurants like Sinatra wonderful and all so close. Breakfast at Jardin good too and short walk from the elevators. BTW, there is a security guard at the elevators checking room keys before you can go up (kind of nice). Both hotels I'm sure are great, but I would stay at the Encore. Get two rooms. You technically could fit 3 in I suppose but two would share the king (which is a really big king) and one would get stuck on the couch.",1
3543,Brian E,Apr 2017,"This is a wonderful resort hotel, on of the best but all depends how you define a Vegas vacation. If your goal is to relax, surround yourself in luxury and occasionally venture out to explore, dine or go to a show, then this is your place. The Tower at the Encore is a fine classy hotel with great service and a really nice ambience On the other hand if you want to be in the thick of it with crowds and shopping and action, then you probably should look further up the strip.",2
3543,C K,Jun 2017,Beautiful property but the staff are very hit & miss and whatever you do DO NOT TRUST anything that comes out of a casino host or Red Card employee's mouth. My advice is to gamble elsewhere and also if you or your significant others actually like to sleep in peace don't let them out you on a side looking in on the property and the nightclubs will be loud and will vibrate your windows.,1

3544,Victoria W,Apr 2017,Hi there it is directly in the strip however it's not 'mid strip' so therefore a very long walk up and down the strip to get around. However when you say 'action' it's very subjective as there is something for everyone along each section of the strip and depends very much on what you are looking for. Hope that helps.,1

The Valley Tower room looked newer and that Tower seemed to be a little more quiet, for what it's worth. The electrical outlets in both our rooms were bad. They worked, but if you pulled at all (like when you use a hairdryer or a straightener), the plug would fall out of the socket.",1

3573,Thomas Q,Mar 2021,"You're asking me if the hotel is as bad as people are saying ? NO. Lobby / Casino is dingy compared to everybody else. The pool wasn't very big; 1 long rectangle. Old fashioned (sort of difficult to climb) stainless steel ladders in deep end. At least it HAD A DEEPEND ! I'M 5'6"" and it was 2 deep 2 stand up in the deepest part of the pool. Poor pool ambience. Many little kids congregating on the ONLY concrete steps in 1 corner of shallow end. Also, there is (no kidding) another adult pool, just 11"" deep for lounging in. Food court was a bargain by Strip standards. My room was about 15 stories high (the highest floor on my wing; other floors go up to ? 24 - 27 ? floors. I looked out on the back of the Venetian annex which was set further in from the strip. It wasn't a great, great vegas view because the Venetian annex was VERY simple w/o any Neon. Just expensive brick, windows, block. I could barely see one beautiful covered pedestrian bridge with automated people movers to scoot people along. Harrah's: clean, no problem with hot water, room keys, elevators, check in woman; 6/2020 no maid service. great tv and more free cable channels than I expected. I'd say the young people, thug clientele wasn't as bad as The Flamingo, but yeh they were there, too. I didn't like the looks or actions of them in the casino. Sports book was shut down when I was there. No problem with the billing as some people complain IN SOME HOTELS. I just had 2 pay resort fees with credit card. Room was free with American Airlines points. Free parking was super close. totally wide open. No gate, card key needed; no need to put paper on the dash of the car. garage was clean, too. You can walk directly across the street and be in caesar's forum shops. in fact, enjoy AC all the way from forum shops to caesars casino and their pool (I used my caesars credit card as a way to go to their pool.) i would highly, highly recommend for the money. I would recommend in general to picky, finnicky people. It's no PARK MGM, or MGM, but yeh, go for it.",1

That was not my experience.,0
3573,sjcruiser36,Mar 2021,"We use to patronize Harrah‚Äôs and the other hotels in Atlantic City for years as we lived 45 minutes away, and this was our first visit to Vegas. The hotel and rooms are clean, modern, and spacious. I chose this hotels since we‚Äôre Harrah‚Äôs/Caesar Club Members, it‚Äôs central location, and how close the rooms are to the casino and street. We were in and out of the hotel and on the casino floor at all times of the day, night, and overnight, and we didn‚Äôt have any issues with the cleanliness or locals. We visited in January, and our issue was that after midnight The Strip was deserted, and most hotels, casinos, or restaurants had limited services. We could have stayed at Caesars Palace for the same price, but when selecting between the two, I didn‚Äôt want to walk a mile through the casino and other areas to get to my room or out the door.

Or you can pay early check in fees range $30-$40, which is still worth taking this, as getting resting up at the new modern rooms, is great to start a new Vegas adventure once energy is charged up. Also, can alway eat at the Harrah food court area, pizza, hot soup, salad, fruits, great desert selection to choose from. There is one Starbuck near the lobby area, can grab something refreshing coffee or smoothie to relax on a little bit. Most restaurant open 24 hours, can still go to nearby CVS and grab snacks or fruits, water, salad, for refreshing up. Mac Donald is just near or next to the entrance area if you are hungry for. Or try the out the Flavors buffet for only range $21.99 to $30, depending what time you going to, can't go wrong for all you can eat-desert, fresh fruits, salad bar, all seafood, unlimited coffee, soda, juice, Asian, Italian, Mexican, American taste of food selections to try for.",0

3616,Jan H,Feb 2019,"I suspect at least part of the reason is that the rooms have different contents based on either the cost of the room or the fact that Diamond (& 7 Stars) players have access to separate floors/rooms. Some have them, most don't. Another reason would likely be to get us to buy coffee at the plethora of coffee stores in the hotel/casino. It does get expensive for frequent drinkers, so either get your own pot OR sit anywhere in the casino and get it free from the cocktail servers!",3
3616,Butchie119,May 2019,"Answering this question as of early 2019..........there USED TO BE coffee makers, cups, etc. in all rooms. However, currently (as of 2019)....there are only coffee makers and accessories in the high roller rooms (7 Stars and Diamond). There are a few different work-arounds if you are not a high roller. Below are the 2 most popular options: 1. If you have access to a vehicle in Las Vegas (ie, drive there with your own car), pack your own coffee maker, coffee, creamer, etc. 2a. If you are flying to Las Vegas and will NOT have access to a vehicle in LV, you can put a compact coffee maker in your suitcase. I usually buy one for about $15 and then just leave it at the hotel and use the space in my luggage for souvenirs or purchases. After all, 2 coffees at the Starbucks in LV will cost about $15 so it's worth it. 2b. The other option if you are flying into LV is to get an Uber/Lyft/taxi (or rent a car) and drive to the nearest Target or Walmart to your hotel. You can purchase a coffee maker, coffee, filters, creamer and sugar for less than $30. If you think about it, the typical drink at Las Vegas Starbucks is about $6. So, multiply that by the number of days you are staying and number of people in your party and see if it's worth it. If you're just staying the weekend, it's not worth it at all.But if you are staying the entire week, that's totally worth it. Again, check your options, do your math, and determine how much you want to be inconvenienced on your trip. It really is a matter of preference.",1

The valley tower have a memory foam topper on the mattress instead of the old spring mattress that is in Mardi Gras. 2. Valley tower has updated bathroom. There is only a shower with a half door. I prefer this over a shower tub combo. But if you enjoy tubs valley tower is not the place for you. Also valley tower has a fogged glass bathroom door. So of you are staying in the room with someone you're not comfortable with this could be very awkward. 3. Valley tower has spa like shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispensers I love this! The first time I stayed at Harrah's I booked a Mardi Gras room, because I didnt know better. Not even 15 minutes later I was back at the check in upgrading my room. Which is very easy.

It's independently owned which means they can offer a great hotel with cheaper rates. Go right to Treasure Island's website and search ALL OVER it for the best price. Expedia will have good prices too. Finally, parking is FREE at Treasure Island. If you're actually staying on The Strip, Treasure Island is great.

You could Uber from downtown to a centralized casino on the strip, but it is definitely not walking distance from Fremont area to the main portion of the strip. Just find a nicer hotel in a more convenient location. The Grand was not impressive. Not at all. Try New York, New York or Paris, or even the Linq are in closer proximity to where it‚Äôs all happening.

It‚Äôs clean, safe and reliable and runs from about 5am until late at night. Google: Wax bus Las Vegas. I think there is even a YouTube video that you can watch in advance to get your bearings at the airport. Only a few stops on the whole route. Best deal in town.",1

3683,Lisa C,Nov 2019,I believe the resort fee is $26 for the down town grand and it is charged at all the hotels in Vegas in various amounts.

It includes a tonne of freebies that values waay more than 26$. Free drinks. Two for 1 deals at multiple restaurants. Free table bet. Free slot machine bet. Reduced entry fee for Mob museum and the nightly comedy show. Few other things too. Resort fee also covers wifi, gym use, etc.",0
3683,slash67024,Nov 2019,"Their 'Guest Experience Fee' is $26.00 per night. Resort fees are never optional, so I don't know why they don't just include it in the quoted room rate. As for what includes, you supposedly get a coupon book (which I never received despite repeated inquiries on my part) sent to your email after check-in for use within the hotel, plus use of the pool, exercise room, parking and such. You know, the things that are included with hotel stays anywhere else WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE. Speaking of parking, I don't recommend parking here. My vehicle was vandalized and items stolen because there is no security in the parking garage. Plus the stairwell has an unsecured door at ground level that allows anyone, such as the numerous homeless on the adjoining side street, unobserved access to the entire structure. Hope this helps.",0
3683,Riggers39,Nov 2019,Hi it‚Äôs $25.99. It includes pool use. Free entry to small gym and WiFi etc. It‚Äôs a compulsory part of the price as with virtually all vegas casinos with the exception of some like the Four Queens that don‚Äôt charge a resort fee.,0

I think you have to get so many points to qualify. The player who gets the most points during their tournament play each day gets free play loaded on their card the next day. I think almost anyone who plays will get a little something. It sounds confusing, but it's not. The slot attendants are really nice and will explain it to you in more detail when you are there.",2

3722,EscapeRoomPanama,Mar 2018,"Yes, there is a resort fee (I think it was around $25) which you can say includes the free parking and Internet. I always try to search for a resort fee free hotel but now a days it's almost impossible. The good thing about this one is that even adding in the resort fee cost it's worth it since the price isnt that high (at least it wasn't when I booked). For the parking space they give you a ticket that is valid for all of the days included in your hotel stay, so you just swipe that ticket all the time and it gives you free access.",0
3722,547nickf,Mar 2018,"Yes there is a fee for both, but it is way less then any other hotel in Vegas. Also they give you a coupon book at check in that makes up for it. 2 for 1 drinks, bogos on food, free play. It's my favorite hotel in Vegas.",0

3747,Mick S,Mar 2017,The management don't seem to have an issue with leaving luggage at the hotel so I cannot see why they would not allow you to use the facilities. I would however caution your choice of hotels by staying at the Downtown Grand. It is some distance from the main strip and it will cost you around $20.00 for a return trip by bus to the main Strip from the hotel. However if you have a vehicle you can drive to the Strip and park for free at a number of the big casinos. I personally had issues with the management during my stay at the Downtown Grand which still have not been resolved some 6 months later which is why I do not recommend to stay at this hotel. I had an issue with a particular staff member at the time who wad totally untrustworthy so you've been warned. There are far better hotels in Las Vegas than the Downtown Grand and I personally would not recommend it to anyone but that is up to you.,0
3747,Don M,Mar 2017,My room was ready early. I would not know for sure but they were extremely polite and helpful. I am a part-time (winter) Las Vegas resident and highly recommend this hotel to my relatives.,0

Even Moving across the street at the Gold Coast it was so loud, to test the tv was turned up to 70 & it could still be heard, they did bring up earplugs. The next night moved to a room on the opposite side of the Gold Coast and it was better, as long as the bathroom window was closed otherwise you could hear it on the backside of that property also. When staying for several nights as we did at some point you do want a few hours sleep, especially if you are there or a tournament, if in Vegas for just a night or two just for partying then that's different.",0

We stay at the Palms a lot and it is not close to many things when walking. A smaller casino across the street and to the Rio. We used to always rent a car but with Uber being so convenient and fast, we take Uber every where when we come to Las Vegas and rarely have to wait over five mins to be picked up. Have fun ! Wish we were going to Vegas over due. PS : Tip if your a Fan Of Seafood and of Gumbo Sister Hotel to the Palms ‚ÄúPalace Station‚Äù Is a place we MUST do each visit to Las Vegas to the Oyster Bar. We always order the Palace Pan Roast. We split it because it‚Äôs so much food. People have waited up to 3 hours to eat there. No kids allowed at the Bar counter where you eat. They have limited seating. Check out the review. Tell your friends staying at the Palms to get Players Card. Use it at the tables, Slots, Restaurants. Even if you go to any of the other Hotels/Casinos linked to the Palms. You can rack up points fast. The Palms is great place. We get offers often in the mail from them. We have never had a bad stay.

3790,Chip N,Jan 2017,"I would not recommend doing what Myndie did (bring a dog without informing the desk). This isn't a pet-friendly property and if they discover you intentionally brought your dog, they can claim that you're in breach of contract (you know all that paperwork that you always sign but never read?). When you sign their agreement, you're ""agreeing"" to their terms for staying at their property. They expressly don't allow pets. If you break this agreement, the Palms is entitled to keep that huge nightly deposit they charge to your credit card. I'm fairly certain that dogs are allowed at The Cromwell and Vdara, but I wouldn't recommend The Cromwell due to the constant drone of music from the nightclub on the roof (on the nights when it's active).",0

The Ivory Tower rooms have been renovated more recently than the Fantasy Tower rooms and I believe the standard rooms in the older rooms may still have tubs, but I'm not certain and I also wouldn't know if they are traditional or jetted tubs. I know that many of the rooms at Palms Place (a separate tower that consists of mainly privately owned suites that are rented out like a hotel) have jetted and standard soaking tubs. If you decide to stay there, do some research into what company or individual is renting the property as some are in beautiful shape while other ones are very run down and haven't been refurbished/remodeled in years.",0

It seems like people leave towels on them and then may leave the pool area without grabbing the hotel towels so you can't tell which are actually taken or not. They need to devise a system as the 3 days we were there we had to put our stuff on a wall and could not lay out.,0

I do not believe this pool will get overly busy. We went early after breakfast and had a choice of all of them and although people came and went throughout the day and the beds did get taken people also moved, that could also be because the sun moved many at the front of the hotel were then in shade.

3816,Nathan H,Sep 2015,"Hi Nel2025, What the other reviewers have posted is correct, our shuttle runs from 11 am to 8 pm each day. To add a bit more, it departs from the hotel every half hour, transporting guests to the Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. The shuttle does pick up guests from the Forum Shops to return to the property as well, but if you wish to return to the hotel beyond 8 pm you will need to find transportation of your own at that point. Taxis are widely available on the strip for 24 hours should that be the case when you visit.",0
3817,Nathan H,Aug 2015,"Hi Ned, The Palms does not have a dedicated shuttle that picks up guests from the airport. There are, however, several shuttle companies that can assist you and have routes that stop near the Palms if not directly there. They typically run about $8-$10 a person but are NOT non-stop routes, so the fastest method of arrival to the hotel is most likely going to be taxi depending on when you set foot in town. The tradeoff for speed is that the cost of the taxi will run more toward $15-$30. Hope that helps.",0
3818,Chris C,Sep 2018,Unfortunately we do not offer airport transportation. I usually recommend rideshare apps such as Uber or Lyft - it's typically less than $20 to/from the airport. A ride to the Strip is usually less than $10.,0

3822,Musigal5,May 2015,"I haven't stayed at the Palms. I've eaten at some of the restaurants, seen concerts there and played in the casino. I think this would be a great place for you. Go to the Ghostbar. Also check out the Voo Doo Lounge at the Rio across the street (51 floors up - a beautiful view). They have good entertainment. I only know that the Palms Towers are right next to the main casino area (west) and the rooms are very nice. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy!",1
3822,Pat S,May 2015,"We stayed in the main hotel and LOVED our room. You can walk across the bridge to the strip (which we would do that again). We would recommend taking a trip out to the Hoover Dam. It's only 30 minutes away and it's awesome! Also you can hike in Red Rock Canyon and that's not far away. Many people do a day trip to the Grand Canyon, but we have not. For entertainment we went to ""Raiding the Rock Vault"" at the Tropicana. It is a rock band made up of entertainers from bands from the 80's. If you buy any tickets get them at the little booths on the strip. We were just in San Francisco, and I would highly recommend driving across the Golden Gate bridge and parking on the Sausalito side and walking the bridge. It's one mile across. we walked half-way and back. There is a restaurant in Sausalito called Salito's Crab House which overlooks an inlet and the food and service was wonderful. Of course downtown San Francisco is fun what with riding the cable car and walking the wharf. There's also a tour of alcatraz which my son, who lives in silicon valley said was really great. Above the golden gate is a mountain that you can drive up that overlooks the entire area. Stanford University in Palo Alto is a great campus to tour also, if you have time. Best wishes and have a great trip. Pat",1

3824,teehee30,Mar 2015,"I was there in October 2014 and there are two pools; the larger one had the majority of the seats/area closed off (which wasn't so great since the sun moved into that area by later afternoon) and then one day we woke up and the pool was drained. We all then went to the second pool, which was much smaller, and therefore much busier with only one pool now. It was difficult to get a seat in the smaller pool. This was late in the pool season so not sure what it would be like early in the pool season. Of course, you can always rent a cabana for $$$$$ and that will definately reserve a spot for you but I don't think you can just reserve a spot unless you are greasing the pool boy or renting a cabana.",1

It's not the fanciest of buffets, but it was good. Also, the line was not very long to get in or to get food.

It's about 2 miles west of Las Vegas Blvd. They have a steakhouse called Nine. You might call them if you want a steakhouse. They have the Ghost Bar which is high up - that's the highest location at the Palms I do believe. The Rio is across the street (behind Caesars Palace). They have the Voo Doo Steakhouse and Lounge which is high up (the 50/51 floor) and a beautiful view.

3849,lhs1,Mar 2018,Best to check with the hotel regarding the pool. Remember This hotel is not in the center of the action so you don‚Äôt really walk around the area. But the shuttle is ok and you can always take an Uber.,1
3849,Tarane12,Feb 2018,Call the hotel they can give you most up to date info,0
3849,Aymara D,Feb 2018,Thank you very much for answering =),0
3849,Virg577,Feb 2018,Katy from Texas is right. We were there Nov 2017 and hotel was great. I believe the renovations they are doing are updating rooms. We stayed on the 5 Th floor it was all done. I would phone the hotel & make sure you get an updated room. They were painting a bit on our floor but very courteous & didn‚Äôt impact our stay. Lovely hotel great that it‚Äôs away from strip. Shuttle runs every hour to strip & has set times to come back. You can walk to the strip we did a few times but it‚Äôs busy roads probably not safe with kids. It‚Äôs a lot of walking so bring runners :),0
3849,Brb1948,Feb 2018,When we were there last year the pool was not impacted. Lots of kids in the pool. Shuttle takes you to the Tropicana and drops you off there. There are set pickup and drop off times. Also shuttle from airport and back is free.,0

3852,Paven K,Aug 2017,Well there was construction all over the place when we were there so we ended up taking a cab.,0
3852,LeAnn H,Aug 2017,No it is not easy to walk to the T Mobile arena. I thought it would be. It is on the other side of the interstate. You would have to walk down underneath the overpass and it looked scary to me. I would stay at New York New York or the Monte Carlo if you want to walk. We drove to the arena and you can park on the 4th floor of the Monte Carlo parking garage if you are going to an event at the Arena. It costs $12 and you can pay online and get a pass through an app that is advertised widely there. I cannot remember the name of the app. It worked good. You do not want to walk!,0

3963,Michael S,Jul 2018,"Hello Sharla, I agree the internet connections where very weak in many location, that's a easy fix, the Hotel has to bring in a professional who will test and do a strength test of the wi-fi signal, we had to do that at the geek Squad repair center in Kentucky, since we do rely on the internet at times. I would have to say they would have to increase those wi-fi hubs around the ceiling, you can see them if you know which ones your looking at. I pointed them out to my group as well since several members where getting upset over that exact issue. It has nothing to do with your phone provider. There is so much steel in that concrete, plus all the other electronic's from all the machines, and camera, and electric power, that is does interfere with the signal.",0

4018,Marlene L,Mar 2019,"This place rocks 24 hours a day, check in anytime. And if you have an Uber or Lyft account may I suggest using it from the airport ad it will be less than half the price of a cab! If u aren't set up with one of them it is worth it to do that before you go..",0
4018,Vegas702,Mar 2019,"There should be no problem at check in, I would just say if you think you will check in after midnight contact the hotel and let them know",0

4018,Gabe,Mar 2019,"No, there‚Äôs no problem.",0
4018,dancer62va,Mar 2019,No. But you will need to let them know you'll be checking in after midnight. They will probably still charge you for the night. But talk to a real person and remember to write everything down.,0

4018,Sherry J,Mar 2019,"Not at all, the hotel is staffed 24/7 and we actually got delayed and didn't check in until 2:30 am and they were friendly, helpful and there was no problem checking in that late. In fact - it was easier because there were no lines!",0

4019,sam86228,Sep 2018,It is not difficult to navigate Las Vegas by car and you will not need to be on the Strip to go from Orleans to Death Valley. Avoid interstates at AM and PM rush hours. Otherwise expect occasional stalls in traffic. Orleans has easy and ample parking. We find it very easy to go anywhere from there and always rent a car.,1
4019,Debbie C,Sep 2018,It's possible not to need to travel through Las Vegas proper to access the highway to travel out to Death Valley. It's a beautiful area and you will enjoy it very much!,1

4019,cshahan,Aug 2018,Its an easy drive. You can get on the highway very quickly without driving through the strip,1
4019,mushkiki,Nov 2018,strip is avoidable and very easy to navigate. airport to hotel is 15 minutes once u got a car.,0

4020,ChavSanti,Jul 2018,"No pets but I would assume they follow the same rules for service dogs. But for a cat, not sure. I think they would consider that a comfort animal and not a service animal. However, I would just put the cat in the carrier and walk right in. I don't think they would even notice and if they see it with a disabled person... They would let it go. Just my opinion though...",0

4020,Kathy D,Jul 2018,"Hi I wasn't sure so I called the hotel and they do not accept service cats, just dogs. They suggested you contact hotels on the Strip to see who would accept service cats. I hope this helps. Kathy",0
4020,allieetal,Jul 2018,I know that they had a relief station downstairs specifically for service dogs. So they do accept service animals. I do not know what paperwork they require to authenticate that an animal is in fact a service dog and not a personal pet.,0
4020,Mark C,Jul 2018,They have a no pet policy. But you can ask about exceptions,0
4020,David M,Jul 2018,"I'm unsure about that,but just to let you know, if the animal helps with stress relief,then I believe it's a comfort animal and not a service animal. Best bet is to call the hotel.",0

4021,RokLov,Apr 2018,I don't think anyone except you book via Email anymore. Just go on-line to their web site and book a room in 2-minutes. Also you get their best non-member price on-line. Remember to join the players Club (free) before you eat or gamble (to get discounts).,-1

4022,lcpotes,Apr 2018,"Hello . Sorry I have not used Advantage Rent a Car at the Orleans. Main questions would be - how are you going to be transported to/fr airport to Orleans ? If you already have transportation and don‚Äôt need a car from start to finish then I would take advantage of their rental at the Orleans. Now, if you don‚Äôt have transportation to/fr airport; then I would consider renting from the airport. There are airport fees and taxes that may be higher than if you pick up from the Orleans - however is it more than taxi fare to/fr airport ? Just a thought.

4024,Williamsgrandma,Jan 2018,No they do not have shuttle to the airport. We always take a taxi and fare is 30.00 with tip. They have free shuttle to the strip that leaves you by the new Prominade and it is great.,2

You must keep the ticket at the back for the return trip to the airport. So no on free shuttle. Hope this helps.",1

4024,Uiopyrfg,Mar 2018,unfortunately no... their shuttle only services the Gold Coast and the Skywheel.,0

4028,CGM Excursions,Sep 2017,Free parking just tip the complimentary valet,0
4028,Stephen Young,Sep 2017,There is no charge even for valet parking (which I recommend since all you do is pull up to the lobby and get out). Give them a small tip ($2-5) and everybody is happy. Give them a bigger tip ($20) and they will park you in one of the 6 slots right next to the lobby doors. That means you have your car in 10 seconds versus 2-5 minutes when you want to leave. Parking with the valet was (to me) was the least hassle option/least expensive. But you can park yourself for free and walk if you like also.,0
4028,MICMERG,Sep 2017,No charge for outside parking,0

When you enter and follow the signs toward the lobby entrance you'll drive right into it. Even at night and entering from a different angle it's easy. Just drive toward all the lights. Are you going to go back out and want your car quicker. Slip the valet a little extra. You did it right if they but a big ""T"" on your stub. Why? There are about 6 parking slots right beside the exit. $20 put me right up front. Wait time when you want to leave... zero. Otherwise it may take about 5-10 mins while they get your car. I was most impressed by this hotel's valet. Better than Wynn. Faster, and less expensive!",2
4029,sharronfl,Sep 2017,Yes there is. It is on the East side of the casino. And if you are staying there and Valet park you just enter the East doors and registration is right inside and to the right.,2
4029,tOmOt_11,Sep 2017,"Yes, and it's a good one. It's located on the east side of the hotel. Watch for signs or personnel directing you to near the east side entrance to the hotel. They will help you unload luggage if desired, and they are a young energetic crew-- available 24 hours.",1

4030,VegasHopper,Jul 2017,"Sorry for being a little late in response. I think you can get a non-smoking room without it being classed as Premium or Deluxe. But, some casinos refer to their lowest class room as deluxe just as a marketing tool. And, I did see several kids while there. Nevada gaming rules apparently prevent hanging out near the gaming areas with kids but there are routes to the various food and lodging areas, so shouldn't be a problem. If you're unfamiliar with Vegas, just remember that getting to the Strip, downtown, or other casinos requires the use of the shuttle bus, taxis, or regular bus routes. If the kids are pre-teen or teen, they may prefer being closer to the Strip or Circus Circus but I don't know what activities are available for kids at the Orleans. Suggest you contact them.",0

Shuttles seem to be running every 45 minutes now it seems. Shuttles make a circular route. Orleans/Strip/Gold Coast. Going to the strip the bus can fill.

4067,Steve V,Aug 2016,Better answered by reservations but I believe it based on floor selection. My rooms have been just a bit higher than the parking garage so a bit more noise and no scenery. A friend who was there at the same time was in a premium room many floors above me also at a different price.,3
4067,CLBNSC,Aug 2016,The view!,1

They had a deluxe room while mine was a premium room.The only difference I noticed was the view. For a couple of dollars more I had a beautiful city view while they had a parking lot view.

4068,TheMrs6464,Aug 2016,The security deposit is about $100 which is usually just pending plus the resort fee. So $100 plus the resort fee together at the time of check in. When you check out the resort fee is process & you get the $100 security deposit back in a day or 2. We got it when we checked out but much later in the day. Hope that helps.,1

4069,Katkem,Jul 2016,"They shut down the Strip to cars and Downtown Fremont has admission fee, minimal. There is usually really good entertainment in the major arenas. Most casinos have parties that you pay to go to and provide the party favors and champagne toast. Some have all you can drink with finger foods. Best to start looking about Sept/oct for lodging and by early Dec. most are sold out! Expect to pay premium prices. The fireworks at midnight is amazing! But on Las Vegas Blvd there is people watching. From Wynn North the crowds are not bad. No strollers, coolers, large bags or backpacks are NOT going to be allowed. Fremont is bands all night! 2-3 stages.",0
4069,taycamsmom,Jul 2016,I'm not sure. We didn't stay at this property - we just spent the afternoon in the casino! You could probably check their website for this info. Good luck.,-1
4069,Linda Dombkowski,Jul 2016,I am sorry I do not have an answer for you. We are not really party animals and tend to do the strip once and then we head out to Red Rock Canyon or Mt. Charles or Lake Mead and Hoover Dam. Hopefully some of the other TripAdvisor reviewers will be able to help you. When we go to Vegas we check the tourist site for what stars are performing at which venues and that's about it. Good luck.,-1

I suspected that it was involved in the area closed off for renovation. We did eat at the buffet and the oyster bar - both were excellent but not 24 hrs. 3. My husband plays blackjack - a lot. All over and around Vegas. He says the Orleans has the nicest dealers and the best odds of any casino and has "" 2 decks, hand dealt $5.00 3 :2."" He says these odds are also available at Southpoint Casino. 4. I have no info about the shutte - sorry. But if you rent a car - parking is free and ample (a huge one level lot - not a deck) at Orleans. So far we have stayed at Orleans, Luxor, Mandalay, Excalibur, Vdara, NyNy, Southpont, Staybridge suites. La Quinta South/Airport and Hilton Garden Inn when in Vegas.

4120,Alonda L,Aug 2017,"Hi, the price I booked online at Hotels com included all taxes and fees and there are not resort fees like most hotels on the strip. The shuttle is 24 hours and leaves on about 10 minutes before the hour to on the hour from the hotel. The strip drop off and pick up is Mandalay Bay and it generally picks up between 15 - 20 after the hour. You have to call them to let them know you need a pick up. It is very convenient we didn't have any problems getting where we need to go.",0
4121,Patrice S,Aug 2017,"that's the beauty of this hotel. there is no resort fee because it is not on the strip or a main tourist attraction. but the price does include tax as with any other hotel. also, the shuttle runs every day, all day but the only thing is you it only goes out on the top of the hour. so for example, its 2:35 am and you are at LaQuinta and want to take the shuttle to the convention center, Mandalay bay, or the airport (the only three places the shuttle will take/pick you up from), the shuttle won't pick you up from the lobby until 3:00am. same deal if you are out at one of the three places they go and you are ready to go back to the hotel. you call the number they give you and they pick you up from the designatwd spot at the top of the hour. also, the shuttle is basically a 8 passenger van with laquinta painted on it. it is air conditioned and the driver is friendly and helps you with your bags if necessary, even opens the door for you.",0

They do ask that you ""sign up"" at the front desk if going to use the service. Obviously there is no need to have a driver if no one needs it and if there are a lot of people they might need two. For the return trip you are given a number to call to arrange to be picked up from designated locations to which they come. They are very efficient. The front desk staff and shuttle drivers are very helpful. We were very happy with the accommodations and shuttle service.",0
4122,Kathy F,Jul 2017,Best to inquire at the front desk (they are extremely helpful). They do provide a shuttle service if you prefer not to drive. You are not far from everything but still not walking distance!,1

4131,Choclovr5,Nov 2016,"You would have to contact the hotel. When you check in as long as you're there it wouldn't be a problem. But, leaving your car for so many days without staying could be a problem.",0
4132,James R,Nov 2016,"Our shuttle operate 24 hours a day. Please contact the hotel when you are in baggage claim and our staff will direct you to the proper pick up location and an approximate pick up time, usually 15 - 20 minutes.",0

4135,391oliviac,Sep 2016,The hotel has a shuttle to the strip. From there you can catch a bus that runs from the strip to Fremont Street. There are bus stops along LV Blvd. (the strip). I believe they have machines by the bus stops to purchase bus tickets.,1
4136,Geoffrey C,Aug 2016,The ground floor rooms are very accessible and the corridors are quite wide which also helps in this hotel. Most hotels have bookable disability access rooms and I am sure this hotel is no exception. The web site will tell you before you book. Alternatively an e-mail to the reception desk will get your answer as they are quite accommodating in that respect. GC.,2
4136,Karen H,Aug 2016,I agree with Geoffrey above. We have never had any problem booking a room on the first floor whether we call the property or e-mail them. The staff at this hotel are absolutely great! and will go out of their way to make sure you are comfortable and satisfied with the accommodations.,0
4137,Mark A,Aug 2016,I used √úber to get around. If you don't have app download it. Use promo code JT8IQ for discount on first ride. It's easy to use. It's cheaper than cab and drivers are very helpful.,1
4137,Kauwes,Aug 2016,"I am not sure specifically about the difficulty of your particular trip, but I can tell you that on our last visit, we tried Uber for the first time and were able to get around the area quickly and inexpensively with it. We were very pleased with the service and will use it in Las Vegas again.",1

4140,Lauren G,Jul 2016,This is a very well managed and clean hotel. We did not see any evidence of any bugs. Would definitely stay there again. One of the nicest hotel and staff.,0
4140,Geoffrey C,Jul 2016,I would be extremely surprised if bed buds were found in this extremely well managed hotel with a first class housekeeping team. GC,0
4140,Kauwes,Jul 2016,"Not sure about that, but I can say that we have stayed here 4 or 5 times and have never had an issue with any kind of bugs and I feel that the housekeeping here is exceptional.",0

4145,steve W,Jan 2016,I am pretty certain that you can leave luggage at the end of your stay and then following checkout pick it up and get the shuttle to the airport. If they subsequently charge for the shuttle it will not be very much........ a good hotel that will look after you,1
4145,Krusedeb,Jan 2016,"Most hotels do this for guests. I have had some charge a small fee, whiles others do it for free-email and ask. They are very guest-oriented there.",0
4145,Bozzybear,Jan 2016,I don't know but I think this is possible! I think they have a luggage room behind reception.,0

4150,Marie Peeters,Aug 2015,Thank you Chris for your helpful answer. We will be vising in Nov from the UK,0
4150,Marion J,Aug 2015,yes!,0
4150,Alistair G,Aug 2015,"Yes you do have to ring. They don't appear to have a regular 'on the hour' or 'half hour' service. Obviously you can use your cell phone to do this or there are phones in the exit area which are free to use. You have to dial a number (possibly 9, but ask at the information desk0 and that gets you through to an operator and then give them the number you want put through to.",0

4151,James R,Aug 2015,Thank you for your question. We do our best to limit pet rooms on the first floor. The best thing to do is note your reservation with your specific request and we will do our best to ensure that you receive a pet free room.,0
4151,travelon2468,Aug 2015,"My suggestion would be to call the hotel directly, speak with a Supervisor, get their name and have them make your reservation stressing that you must have a pet free room for health reasons. This should avoid problems at check-in. Have a good trip!",0
4151,Serenamac,Aug 2015,That's a question to call the hotel about?,0
4152,James R,Aug 2015,Thank you for your question. St Gabriel the Archangel Church is approximately 1 mile from the hotel. It's about a 15 - 20 minute walk.,1
4152,Phxman,Aug 2015,"The closest one I remember is St. Gabriel the Archangel Catholic Church - 2250 East Maule Ave., Las Vegas, NV 89119-4607, 702.361.2431. It's about 3-4 blocks in a line to the southeast (off of Eastern) or about 5-6 blocks if you use the streets to get there.",1
4152,Steven G,Aug 2015,I just checked on Google and it looks like there are two within an easy walk. I would suggest you do the same to see if you consider the distances acceptable. My dog and I walked considerably farther than the further of the two but it depends on what you consider an acceptable distance as well as the time of day since it can get very hot in Las Vegas in the warmer months.,1
4153,luv2travlSnohomish,Jul 2015,Your pets are family at our hotel and always welcome. We do not have a size limit on pets and we never charge a deposit or fee! We look forward to having you as our guest! Alison,0

4155,James R,Jul 2015,"Thank you for your question. We provide courtesy shuttle service to and from the strip every hour on the hour. If the shuttle is full and we have a driver available we will do our best to provide an additional trip but because we are a very busy airport property, we cannot guarantee that we can have a second shuttle since our airport runs are every half hour. If you sign up in advance we know how many will be on the shuttle and can cut off the sign up sheet after ten people.",0
4156,James R,Jul 2015,Thank you for your question. We allow guests 18 years and older with valid ID.,0

4163,James R,Mar 2015,"Thank you for your question. If you are arriving from the International Terminal (3) we will pick up at door 53. The shuttle for pick-up is on call. The terminal has courtesy phones available for your convenience to call us directly. If you are picking up a rental car the next morning, we will take you to the rental center.",2
4164,James R,Mar 2015,"Thank you for your question. Since we are the Airport South property we are not close to Silver Seven Hotel & Casino. Our hotel provides hourly service to Town Square which is the location of about 20 restaurants. Village Pub is located within walking distance. Our breakfast starts at 6am, but we do have a bagged breakfast option. Please be sure to let the front desk know that you are leaving early.",0
4165,James R,Mar 2015,Thank you for your question. Keurig Coffee Machines are provided in our guests rooms. We provide regular and decaf K-cups. Additional coffee is available upon request.,2

4166,curban17,Mar 2015,This hotel along with all La Quinta locations have a 24 hour front desk staff and they will be there to greet you with a friendly smile no matter how late you arrive.,1
4166,Trekking,Mar 2015,"They should be able to receive guests at any time. However, you should call and give them a heads up about your planned arrival time to ensure a room will be ready when you arrive. I believe Las Vegas Airport South's telephone number is 1-702-492-8900.",0
4167,James R,Mar 2015,"Thank you for your question. We provide shuttle service to and from the car rental location. If you would like, we can pick you up at the airport so you can enjoy a good night sleep at the hotel. The next morning we can take you to the car rental location.",0
4167,rentaquote,Mar 2015,"The car rental depot for McCarran Airport is not actually at the airport. It's on Gillespie Street - south of the runway - and not too far from the La Quinta Airport South. If you make arrangements the night before, the hotel minibus will take you directly to the car rental depot without having to go back to the airport and catch another shuttle. So for convenience and to save time and money, it makes sense to pick up your car in the morning. We did exactly this and it all worked out fine. The other issue is where to get dinner on the evening you arrive. If you're happy to grab something at the airport, you don't need a car. But if you wanted to go downtown, it would be helpful to have wheels. Dining options around the hotel are limited... It's a grim 10-15 minute walk along East Sunset Road to Taco Bell and a McDonalds.",0
4167,A Tripadvisor Member,Mar 2015,Depends when you are leaving. Rentals are for 24 hours so if you are leaving late it's best to get the car that night at 8:30 because if you get it in the morning they will charge you for another day anyway if you drop it off at 8:30pm. I hope that makes sense. If you're leaving around the same time in the morning then pick it up in the morning.,0
4167,marcelonyc,Mar 2015,If you have plans to leave the hotel early in the morning I thi k is better to get the rental the day before otherwise Teresa and Mark suggestions are a good idea also.,0
4167,Mark H,Mar 2015,"Personally, I would just get it in the morning. Food is at least a block from the hotel, so you might want to eat at the airport, walk, order a pizza, or catch the shuttle to the strip.",0
4167,Teresa B,Mar 2015,If the cost for the extra day is an issue then wait. The airport is very close so the shuttle back and forth is easy. If isn't an issue then go ahead and get the car. Parking at LaQuinta is free and you would be able to get an early start on your way to the Canyon. Happy travels!,0
4168,James R,Feb 2015,Thank you for your question. We do our best to limit pets to the first floor but sometimes owners will not tell us that they brought a pet.,1

4229,lms35041,Jul 2018,"I do like the Suncoast, although I have not stayed at the JW. The rooms are better than many Strip hotels - NYNY and Mirage for example where I also stay at during the same 9-10day trip 4 times a year. I enjoy all the hotels as they each offer something different. The rooms at 550sqft are larger than the above at 400, which do not have the floor to ceiling windows that the Suncoast has or a golf course view (JW is the otherside of the golf course). Few if any Standard Strip rooms have sofas and fridges. Being a bit newer than many Strip it was built as they started to realise people wanted more than somewhere to shower and sleep. But the rooms are not over the top so less than $50-80 midweek and $125-150 weekend nights. It is awhile since I paid for a room as the casino gives me comped (free) rooms. The Suncoast as a whole goes after the locals market with a smallish hotel tower they can fill with a few vacationers who just want to visit the Strip a few days per trip. They do some conventions themselves. It is about a mile in summer heat so Uber would be better, at least the first time. A very small fare. Walking you would go out the west entrance to the left hand corner of the car park, walk the width of a golf course then navigate the JW property.",0

There was no mention of a fee based shuttle starting and the page on the website has been removed (Which promted my email to them).

It was about $20 with tip - which seemed a lot. I had looked on the map and the taxi driver had taken a direct route. There is a Las Vegas taxi farefinder that said that was right. There is Uber. The WAX bus from the Suncoast goes to Charlston Blvd, then crossing the intersection the 208 goes to Red Rock Casino ($3 for 2h ticket). Hot and Slow so not really an option. So you are looking at an extra $40 a day for taxi if you cannot get into the Red Rock or if it is that more expensive. I like the Suncoast (I am staying again in Oct) and stay often but certainly the Red Rock is the Bellagio of the off-strip hotels.",1

4239,6Liddells,Mar 2017,"Yes. You have to walk through the casino )smoking) to get to the elevators to the rooms. The pool operates seasonally, so check ahead. There is a movie theater, bowling alley, and arcade. Most of the Restaurants in the hotel are fine for kids.",0
4239,KellySebring_OH,Feb 2017,Yes it would. Nice smoke free rooms. Also this casino is less smokey during the week. They have a nice large secured and supervised kids play area. So you can let them play while you play in the casino.,0
4239,awm1,Feb 2017,"Absolutely. There is a bowling alley,ice cream parlour and a theater on the premises. There is also a pool (which depending on when you go may be closed for the window). There are shopping centers nearby and of course the Red Rock Canyon is nearby. There is a casino on the premises but it is not huge by comparison. It is a nice hotel",0
4239,Barry S,Feb 2017,"Although rooms aren't smokey, the entire casino reeks of smoke, from the moment you walk in, and each time you must walk thru the casino to get to your room. I personally wouldn't go back there just for that reason. As many people indicated, there are some things to do - game room, bowling alley and theater on premise. But how much time can you spend at those places? FYI - There's a mall across the road with some great restaurants. But a few great things to do not too far from the casino, whether you stay there or not.: Red Rock Canyon was a great place to go! 13 miles of scenic park with a half a dozen stops to get out and hike! Can easily make this a 4-8 hour endeavor depending upon the age of your kids, your interest in hiking and and getting outdoors. Bring snacks and drinks with you, and if you're going to make it a day,, bring lunch! It'll break up the day. A second trip (which we didn't do this trip) that's only about an hour away is Hoover Dam. It's amazing if you've never seen it. I understand things are a little more restrictive now then 30+ years ago when I was there but it's a great day trip! Last suggestion especially if you have kids and they're at least 12 and up, is Pole Position Raceway. It quickly gets pretty spendy but this indoor go cart raceway was a great way to spend an afternoon. It's about 20 minutes from the hotel. Check it online first. (Call and ask for a discount if you have a group.) There were a few other hotels in that area that I personally would check out first. Good luck!",0
4239,David C,Feb 2017,"Yes it is suitable for children. It has a game room, bowling Alley, Multiscreen Cinema, Several restaurants. The only downside is you have to go through the casino area to get to the venues",0

Just be aware you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel elevators and restaurants.

Also, the pool is closed in the winter/off season months, so check with the hotel first if that is something your children would like.",0

It is $2 per journey or $5 for 24h. The bus stop is part of a Park and Ride scheme in the carpark so is 100-150 yards from the hotel entrance.

From there you can head to the Bonneville Transit Center at 101 E Bonneville Ave Las Vegas, NV 89101 to pick up public transportation. The Westcliff Airport Express (public transportation) picks up there which will circle back to Suncoast after it‚Äôs trip around the city. If you are arriving near the airport you can pick up the WAX (Westcliff Airport Express) bus at Terminal 1, Level 0 as well. This bus takes $2.00 exact cash per person.

It stops at the Tropicana hotel and the stop coming back is outside the NYNY hotel. The bus also goes to Downtown and Premium Outlets (North). And to both Airport Terminals where the hotel shuttle only goes to Terminal One where you would need to get the nearby inter-terminal shuttle to T3..,1
4259,LMC,Sep 2014,I do not believe there is a shuttle to the strip. We rented a car to get around.,0
4259,tonyandlynndi,Sep 2014,We have always rented a car because they are cheap and parking on the strip is generaly free at the casinos. There is so much more to Vegas than just the strip and you would need a car or you will spend more on other forms of transportation.,0
4259,Janneykins,Sep 2014,I believe they only have a shuttle to/from the airport. As they are a casino hotel I wouldn't think they'd want to send their business to the strip by providing a shuttle there. We had a rental car (rental cars are usually quite reasonable in Las Vegas) which gave us a lot of flexibility.,0

4268,Bear C,Oct 2021,Valet is $15 per hour.,0
4268,Diana,Oct 2021,They do charge for parking. I believe it was $8 an hour which is steep by downtown standards. The garage is well lit and was very clean. We only stayed about 40 minutes because of the very loud music in the place.,0
4268,Paul Hunter,Oct 2021,When I last visited CIRCA there was a fee for BOTH visitors and guests. As a guest I was advised to leave my car with valet to avoid the fees.,0

4273,Alex O,Jul 2021,"Wrong, if you are staying at the hotel, pool access is included. You do not have to pay an entrance fee. As for chairs, there is a certain area where the chairs are at no cost but they are first come first serve. There are quite a few but you still have to get to the pool relatively early to ensure you get one. Hotel guests also have earlier access to the pool than the general public. I think it's like an hour or two before. So if the pool opens to the general public at 9 then hotel guests have access around 7:30-8:00ish.",0
4273,kathyhK9551WZ,Apr 2021,It depends on the time of the year. You still have to pay the entrance fee and it includes a chair. At the high volume times there may be additional fees. There are pools on different levels each requiring different rules.,0

As she was giving us our keys, she said that she had upgraded us to the bungalows on the first floor. We had a small laini, two metal chairs and a small round metal table. Our room faced the west toward the strip. The only problem was that we couldn't use it in the afternoon because of the Las Vegas heat-fine in morning and evening. Housekeeping staff was wonderful, took time to answer questions. The concergie service was very helpful too. The halls to the bungalow where we stayed were quite long. Could have used roller skates.

Tropicana Guest Services",0
4309,John W,Jan 2019,I have never been to the grand arena so not really sure where it is located. I can tell you that the Tropicana is literally right across the street from the MGM Grand hotel and you take a overhead walk way over to the MGM hotel where you would find signs directing you to the arena,1
4309,Leigh-Traveler2015,May 2019,"Yes, its close. I think there are other Hilton properties that must be nicer than this place. Its dated. Theres really nothing here for Honors members. No lounge, no perks, even the free water is a miniature bottle. Im Diamond- got $15 towards breakfast (not each) but a standard cheap-o breakfast for 1 starts at $25...coffee is not even complimentary with meal- $6. They charge for a cup of water. The sheets have holes in them, the floor is wet in places and sticky in others. I would rate it a 2 star or maybe a 3 at best. If I were Hilton, i would implode this place and start over-",0

4311,Captain-obv,Dec 2018,We are gold members as well and just stayed at the property. They do not have a continental breakfast so they offer a dining credit instead. We received $13 per person each morning to use in the hotel. You will charge the meal to your room and they deduct the credit from it. I believe they said the credit was limited to two per room and does not carryover to the next day.,2
4311,Leigh-Traveler2015,May 2019,"No free breakfast. You will get a $13 credit to your room- not per person, TOTAL. Breakfast menus start at $16 for the cheapest option but does not include a cup of coffee. The breakfast buffet is $25 and your best value IF you eat a bunch. I just had 2 eggs bacon and coffee...$24. I wouldve had the buffet instead had i known a cup of lukewarm not-so-good coffee would be $6. Im Diamond.

4324,bigo777775,Aug 2018,I recommend from the airport if you are alone to just take the shuttle for $11. Tropicana is the first stop. Only buy ticket for one way and take cab back. Doorman at Tropicana told me should be able to get cab ride for $16 to $20 to and from the airport. Just Google cab companies in Las Vegas and they will be able to give you cost and tell them how many in your party. I used shuttle to and from Tropicana and return trip was very late and a pain. Thanks to members for telling me about monorail from MGM. I will try that on my next trip to Vegas.,1
4324,Leapy L,Aug 2018,If you are travelling without much luggage there is a bus called the WAX and it leaves from the back of the airport terminals and stops across the road from the Tropicana. From memory it is three stops from the airport and you can pay the driver $2 each.,1

4324,Zenzar123,Aug 2018,Do you mean airport shuttle service or other? There is a monorail that can be used and runs to various locations on the strip,1
4324,fibonbon,Aug 2018,Definitely Uber or Lyft. We used both in Vegas and Lyft was cheaper than the bus down the strip if you were only making one stop.,0

I had a similar promotion and was told that it was good for all of the restaurants, including the steak house, but because of my schedule, I only used my credits at the beach cafe.

4327,Michael N,Jul 2018,Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately we do not. Taxi or Uber is the best way. We are 3.5 miles from the Airport so the fare will be reasonable.,0

There is a monorail that runs from the MGM which is across the street from the Tropicana that you can take from there to several hotels including the Flamingo.

The hours may be different from when we were just there now its getting warmer later.",1

Anyway, talk to the front desk and ask the best solution and enjoy!",1

4338,Thecroydonway,Apr 2018,hi there it's open till 5pm while I was there but I think they will extend as the season progresses but worth checking if you like the pool as its early for it to close. They will need to see you room key to let you in and will provide towels. They supply chilled water on the bar for free and there's drinks to buy. Worth noting you can only take food from Starbucks just inside the hotel pool side which was a bit of a pain but we sneaked in our own stuff lol. Hope you go enjoy the place it was great fun,0

However, they did me a solid. I checked in at the Hilton Honors counter out in the main lobby, and the guy upgraded me to a room 2/ 2 queen beds when I really needed. After I made my 2 night reservation (for myself only,) my married buddy needed to stay with me for just the 2nd night.

4348,Ian A,Feb 2018,"Hi, This hotel is part of the Hilton chain. It has recently been bought out by another major hotel company and is keeping Hilton as the operator. In the past, it was possible to negotiate rooms depending on how much one spends gambling. But, not now. The refurbishment process has started and they will update the rooms ( eventually).I am a Lifetime Diamond member and quite frankly if I were you I would pay for a standard room then, on check-in, negotiate a 'room with a view on a high floor in the same tower as the main entrance!

4348,JoeyNumbers,Feb 2018,I agree I really don't think you're going to be spending too much time in your room so I wouldn't pay for any upgrade whatsoever I would use the money for going out on the town,0

4349,Dinahmyte,Feb 2018,"I've no idea. The pools are outside and unheated, so I guess it depends on if the weather is hot enough for sunbathing. Would recommend calling the hotel but you could just pack your bathers anyway!",0
4349,Owllady1,Feb 2018,I would say yes but you should contact the hotel to be sure. Make sure you ask about the temperature. There are some shady spots around the pool area,0

We felt that the Savor buffet was less extravagant that others we tried. The setting and offerings were pretty standard; nothing bad just not memorable. Some of the other hotels go over the top which can be fun. Have fun.",0
4351,VaAlleyCat,Feb 2018,"From the Tropicana website today (2/1/18): What is your resort fee? You should know that most Las Vegas hotels and casinos charge a daily resort fee that is in addition to the cost of the hotel rooms you have booked. While some resorts charge upwards of $40 per day, we offer guests a daily resort fee of just $35 plus taxes. Can the resort fee be waived if we are not using any of the services? Unfortunately, no. Why do you have a resort fee? The simplest way to explain it is that when you book your room, you are paying to use the hotel room. The resort fee allows you to enjoy other parts of our resort and casino, and at a discounted rate from what non-hotel guests are charged to use the same amenities. What does the resort fee include? In-room high-speed wireless Internet Daily fitness center access Two complimentary bottles of water in-room per stay Buy-one, get-one-free signature cocktails, wine by the glass and craft beer in the Oakville Steakhouse Bar/Lounge from 5-7 p.m. daily 2-for-1 tickets to Laugh Factory (excludes Friday and Saturday) Free valet and self-parking Use of the pools and whirlpool spas (seasonal) Free local calls Free 800 toll-free calls Free printing of boarding pass",0

The gold nugget casino has the largest ""gold nugget on display in their lobby and is free to see. Also at the Gold Nugget is the shark tank swimming pool that is neat to look at.

It's not how much you lose. Like any casino, comps are based on a formula that accounts for your average bet x the amount of time you stay at the tables.

You can open the window more than a few inches in a cabana suite, which is just across one street from the main hotel/casino, and only 3-4 levels...but still not too much there either. The dark side of Las Vegas tries to prevent security and hotel personnel from dealing with anyone jumping out of anymore windows or off ledges.

Good luck and I hope that you have a brilliant time.",0
4409,Junior S,Sep 2015,"There are different shuttle bus companies that operate 24/7 from the airports to all parts of Las Vegas. The Las Vegas bus drivers are pretty knowledgeable on drop off locations. Typically you will want to ask the driver when you want to be picked up and they'll tell you to be at a specific place and time. The shuttle bus will swoop by to pick you up and drop you off at the airport. Your travel on the shuttle bus back could be 1.5 hours, where in a cab, you might only be 20 minutes. If you're trying to get some extra sleep, then I would recommend a cab instead. Ex: If you want to be at the airport at 6am coming from downtown, the driver might tell you to meet at Fremont & 6th Street @ 4:30am because he might need to pick up at 6 other locations after you, before heading to the airport. You could be the start of that roundabout.",-1

The rooms are more sound proofed than the Tower Rooms in the Casino. Complimentary Fruit and Candy in the lobby and exercise room is very nice with Flat Screen TVS water cooler and plenty of towels.

4423,hategoingtowork,Sep 2014,"Look, it's Vegas. If you are expecting decor and service like Hotel George V in Paris, you're going to be disappointed. The El Cortez is a nice place to stay, but the price you'll be paying has an implicit understanding that you aren't going to have fresh rose pedals on your bed each day. In addition, the El Cortez wasn‚Äôt built last month. Some of the rooms in the hotel date back to the Roosevelt Administration. You will get, however, decent rooms, a decently clean property, decent staff, and as much Old Vegas as any casino-hotel can provide in 2014. I think you'll find the accommodations up to your satisfaction if you go with the right expectations. But I can give you one data point to consider. We were having trouble with our Junior Cabana room's safe. I called, expecting to have an engineer stop by later that day or the next. No big deal. But they had a security tech knocking at my door within 10 minutes of my phone call. Nice. Will that level of service always be available? Don‚Äôt know, but that's what they are capable of. They seem to be willing to please, especially if you are polite and friendly in return. That's usually the case everywhere in Vegas. Are they going to comp your entire stay and throw in a lobster dinner if you notice some chipped paint in your room? Probably not. But I suspect that they might offer to move you to a comparably priced room if the joint isn‚Äôt busy. My bottom line answer? Whenever I stay downtown, it's at the El Cortez. Nick in Palm Springs",2

4426,Angel,May 2015,"Si vamos a ser honestos lo ideal para alojarse ser√≠a en Las Vegas Blvd, que es donde est√°n los hoteles famosos, pero son, por ende, costosos. El Cortez est√° en Fremont St, a una cuadra del bus que puedes pagar por 24 o 48 horas y que pasa por todos Las Vegas Blvd, as√≠ que no tienes que gastar mucho en transporte al interior de Las Vegas; adem√°s est√° cerca, por ejemplo del Gold & Silver Pawn Shop (el Precio de la Historia que dan por History), as√≠ que es una muy buena opci√≥n de ubicaci√≥n y no tan costosa. En relaci√≥n con el Wi-Fi, si mal no recuerdo, hay que pagar pero relativamente poco por el d√≠a. Espero sea de utilidad el consejo.",0

4429,Nicole,Sep 2019,"We were told that they are separate resorts. You may not use the facilities at Tahiti Village unless you are a registered guest there. One family found out about that when they were at the Tahiti. Tahiti Village is bigger and closer to the strip as well. Note that when we stayed at the Tahiti, one pool was closed all week. Another guest posted that both pools were closed when they stayed there. Not sure why that is??? But beware.",1
4429,Penny,Aug 2019,They are both the same company as the shuttle bus to the strip stops at both hotels. The other hotel is bigger and contains a lazy river and is a little more expensive to stay from what I can see.,1

4449,islandlass2,Mar 2017,"I suggest you first try to make the changes through the same method you first booked the room. If you did it on-line then try to make the changes on-line through the same source. Since the Resort has what they call ""third party reservations"", they most likely will tell you that they can't make the change. If you booked with the Resort directly then they should be able to make changes, on-line or by phone. The one problem I see is that they may not have a vacancy for the additional date. If all else fails, call the Resort to see if they can help you make the changes. Good luck!",0

4452,musiknalldat,Jan 2017,"The is a shuttle, but it's just to The Strip, Fremont St., and major areas. There is a cab stand with a corral line at the airport that moves pretty fast and the cost of the taxi is very reasonable. We used UBER the entire time to get around from the Tahiti, but once, and it was great. The Tahiti in case you aren't aware is about 3 miles from The Strip, but it is actually a respite from the non-stop hustle of The Strip. There is a large strip mall next to it with a 24 hr. Walgreens, and several well known food chains. Have a great time!!",0

4460,newfie_penney,Oct 2015,yes the pool is heated - most times by the sun though.,0
4460,newfie_penney,Oct 2015,Yes it is - most times it is by the sun anyway,0
4460,Kathy Parrillo,Oct 2015,Not sure... Did not go to the pool,0
4460,Hostoco,Oct 2015,I am not sure if it is heated. I don't believe the pools are not open year round so it is best to call 702 440-6800 the front desk and find out.,0
4460,Ann B,Oct 2015,I was there in the summer and it was over 100 degrees outside and it had been for more than a month. When it is that hot the water temp for (almost) standing water is going to be very warm and of course the pool temp would be high as it would for all pools. It is only necessary to heat pools when the weather outside is chilly or cold. I don't know when you are going but if it is in the spring summer or autumn the pool temp will not be a factor. In fact you'll probably enjoy it more if the water temp was cooler so it can cool down your body temp. If you're concerned about t in the winter then it wold be a good idea to call the hotel directly.,0
4460,Opplbonnie,Oct 2015,The pool closest to the main lobby was heated when we were there last week and the hot tub was very warm.,0
4460,Theresa G,Oct 2015,I was there in May and it was heated at that time. Maybe they turn off heat during the summer?,0
4460,aperez77,Oct 2015,Not when we went in June. But there is a hot tub as well.,0
4460,Angela M,Jul 2016,No need to heat the pool in the summer. The sun heats the pool. The water is usually cooled in the summer or it would be too warm.,-1
4461,Ann B,Aug 2015,I'm sorry to say I do not have that information because with our resort plan we do not pay for the individual stay. It comes off our time share fees. And staying at Tahiti I usually bring some grandchildren so we opt for the 2 bedroom configuration which always includes a sofa bed in the adjoining living room. Why don't you call them directly and ask. You are allowed to go in place of the owners so don't let that frighten you about asking.,0
4461,Scienceonseven,Aug 2015,We paid $75 to upgrade for the entire week to meet the accommodations you have asked about.,0
4461,newfie_penney,Aug 2015,Sorry I was thinking about Tahiti Village. Not Tahiti Resort. Discard my answer. We stayed in a limited kitchen vs a studio - and I think if memory serves me well - it was about $40 difference in price. But you can email or call and they are pretty good in getting back to you with requests.,0
4461,newfie_penney,Aug 2015,Every unit already has a sofa bed. Moorea unit - king bed in Bedroom and sofa pull out in Living Room area. Bora Bora unit - king bed in Bedroom and sofa pull out in Living Room. Royal Tahitian - both units listed above. I am pretty sure they have roll away cots that they can add one more to your unit.,0

4464,Ann B,Oct 2015,My husband and I are also seniors and it's one of the questions I always have when booking a hotel. Yes Tahiti certainly does have more than one elevator. However if you leave togged your car in the lots on the side or back there are a few steps (maybe 4 to six) to negotiate but a ramp is also there depending upon which is more accessible to you.,0
4464,Scienceonseven,Jul 2015,There are many first floor rooms. In fact I was very pregnant with twins during our stay and asked for a room on the first floor to make things easier and more accessible. There does happen to be an elevator. In fact the hot tub has a handicap lift as well. There was another customer who used it to transfer from her wheel chair into the hot tub.,0
4464,grcCamanoIsland,Jul 2015,"Yes, there are elevators. They are located at various places in the building.",0
4464,conativeGj,Jul 2015,Yes there are elevators conveniently located throughout the building. I would suggest calling the resort and asking for a room located fairly close to an elevator. Not right next because of noise. I like to stay in rooms with pool view. . get morning sun plus balcony is a nice place to enjoy coffee and listen to the birds.,0

We do have a few, however, and they are all deluxe suites. Frankly, they do not offer ideal Strip views if that's what's important to you. We would recommend staying on an upper floor, which would give you the best view. We would hasten to add that we do not guarantee specific room types. Guest units are assigned at check-in and based on availability. You can, however, request an upper-floor deluxe room with a Strip view on your reservation to give yourself the best chance of obtaining one. In case you're referring to Tahiti Village, our sister resort, we can tell you it does have high-rise guest towers with excellent Strip views. Again, no room guarantees but you can request a Strip view on your reservation. We hope this helps!",0

4492,Joseph M,Jul 2018,The parking is free. Even when I stay at another hotel further away from the Strip I usually park here and they haven't said anything to me. I do usually get a bite here if I park at this place.,0

4493,Johnvkim,Nov 2017,They have a huge parking lot and a multi level garage. Check with the Bell desk and they should be able to assist you. I would tip the guys before and after to insure that they keep an eye on your car while you are gone.,0
4494,dawsons2014,Oct 2017,To go to the strip the bus is just across the road a few yards away. Coming back from the strip it stops right outside the door couldn't be better hotel is in great location for buses they run every 15 minutes.,1

4496,Sashmom1,Aug 2017,"When you arrive at the airport in Vegas, you take the courtesy shuttle from terminal 3 to terminal 1. The Silver 7 Shuttle takes off from Terminal 1. If you have your reservation papers to show them then you can take the shuttle. It's for registered guests only so if you've got a reservation and you won't have a mobile phone with your details, I'd advise you to print out your reservation papers and bring them with you. The shuttle goes to the hotel pretty often so you shouldn't have to wait very long. I hope this helps.",2

4496,Two_Es_NYC,Oct 2017,"Shuttle does not run as scheduled (supposed to every hour) stating at 4;20 am - 9:20 pm). Last time I booked Silver Sevens, I arrived at LAS in the mid afternoon (so this was not early morning or late night) and was waiting at the designated pick-up spot a the airport for about an hour-and-a-half. It was either take Uber or Lyft or wait a few more minutes. i'd already waited this long, plus it's one of their amenities that's i booked the hotel. So, I had to call the front desk to tell them that I was waiting for the shuttle. It arrived within 30 mins. I wish Silver Sevens would pick-up at the time they're supposed to pick-up regardless, if they have passengers or not. It's only every hour. So, to answer the question, yes call a the courtesy desk at the airport and tell them you have arrived. Too bad there aren't any more phone booths.",0

The answer was that they need to authorise a credit card when you check in but you may use cash to pay the balance when checking out.

4549,AZamo1,Jan 2019,With regards to a service dog tagging along at Palace Station I don't think it will be a problem. As a matter of fact while we were there we saw a couple of people with dogs like you describe a little yappy things and no one batted an eye and they were perfectly accepting,0
4549,Paula R,Jan 2019,"I do not need a Service dog so can‚Äôt give feedback, regarding your question. But, My husband and I have stayed here often and @ the sister Hotel - The Palms Hotel and neither of us ever remembering seeing anyone with a service dog. I am sure they have to allow it with the disability act. I had never noticed at Walt Disney World in Fl until my last two visits and they were every where. So I think it is becoming more utilized service with people. I also suggest calling the hotel. I would suggest asking to speak to a Casino Host. They maybe able to give a promotional stay or discount. It never hurts to ask They have been great to us. We often get a free room. Not sure if they still do it but on our last two stays we got a discount at the Steak Restaurant ‚ÄúThe Charcoal room‚Äù. Food /Service was excellent. I believe it was a coupon. Was great deal. They also have excelllent Happy Hour in the Bar. The Oyster Bar Restaurant in Palace Station is one of our must eat at each trip into Las Vegas. Wait times can be long to be seated but the Excellent food is worth it. It has limited Bar type seating. If you go get a player‚Äôs card and use it every place in the casino you spend money. It adds up on your comps. Even use at the restaurants. And if you play Bingo the New Bingo Room is great/ Staff is very nice. And if you go to any of the Sister Casinos use your card. Good luck. They just under went Renovations and have a new pool I am excited to go back and see what all they have done. If you go enjoy and Win Big !",0

If you are looking for cheap and clean you have reason to be concerned. Try the Jockey Club next to the Cosmopolitan. It offers deep discount rates. It's older but very clean. Great if you are on a budget, and do not care about a view. The location is fantastic. The Linq also has offered cheap specials, be sure you get a newly renovated room.

Shower only so it was not the best, but we booked way in advance so we didn't pay much. It's like a decent motel. I felt it was well worth what we paid. I can't speak for other reviewers. I liked that it's close to the pools and parking. I'm sure the tower rooms are much nicer though. The casino and restaurants were very nice. We had a car so we could go to Hoover Dam, Neon Sign Museum, downtown, etc. But they have a shuttle from the airport and back, and a shuttle to the Fashion Show Mall on the strip and back. We took that when we wanted to do some drinking and cabbed it back. We walked a good part of the strip to see the fountains at Bellagio and ride the Ferris Wheel. There's a public bus that will go to Fremont St. downtown from the strip.The shuttle schedules are posted on their website. The area isn't bad, but the street is wide and busy and you're near the freeway. There are restaurants across the street (Landry's, Marconi's, etc.) and a 7-11 near the far end of the parking lot. I wouldn't walk to the strip from there though. It's on Sahara Ave.and it's kind of far from the major hotels. This was a budget vacation for us and we had a great time. I hope this helps and your vacation will be as good as ours!",0

I recently stayed in the towers.. these were very nice, almost suite looking. Ask for those if you can w view or not... hotel is a Hotel, not motel. Good quality, at least 3 to 4 star.

Also you Can not miss Trying the Oyster Bar here ! It's one of the top 10 Oyster Bars in the USA ! It's so worth the long wait. We had been here several years and wondered about the long lines, now we are apart of the long lines every trip to Las Vegas. Also at this Hotel they will give you coupons at check in.

4590,Linda Donewald,Mar 2016,"During my travels throughout the U.S., I have encountered several hotels that no longer offer coffee makers in rooms as many travelers do not use them. This is partially due to raised concerns about whether they are sanitary (which begs concerns about health as well). Generally, my findings have been that hotels having adequate food and beverage establishments on property or nearby may no longer offer microwaves or refrigerators in rooms. It has been my experience at Palace Station that a mini-refrigerator can be placed in your room if requested prior to or at check-in. If you have any concerns about the level of service you have received at Palace Station, or perhaps compliments or complaints about the omission of amenities, I highly recommend contacting the hotel manager's office directly rather than using any contact form to message online.",0
4590,Michael D,Mar 2016,"Most hotels in Las Vegas, especially on ""The Strip"" omit these items in their rooms. Some even omit ice machines on the floors.

There is a self-parking ramp right next to the hotel with elevators that come down to the back of the reception/gift shop area near Starbucks. Used it several times. Some of the room rates include free valet parking. Why stand around waiting when you can just walk to your car & get in and leave?,1
4603,mocpgc,Feb 2015,Yes parking is free but I give the valet at least a dollar for getting me my car. Not just good for one night but even better for more. We have never gone home a loser from their slots yet. Knock on wood.,1

4605,PopUpShop,Mar 2015,"First stay I had the 'included courtyard' room as part of my air/hotel package. I got there VERY late Saturday night - the weekend of Super Bowl. My Bad. I had NO idea all of LV was going to be a mad-house. I probably got one of the very last rooms that hadn't been given out. My courtyard room was on the 2nd floor and yes, you have to slug your luggage up 2 flights of stairs as that building has NO elevators. My room was just fine - bed, bathroom, TV. No complaints there. My only issue was: the heater/AC unit was unplugged and the knobs missing off of it. That is supposed to be controlled by the wall thermometer. Wrong. It was broken. My room was very chilly and I ended up getting up and grabbing my winter coat and throwing it over the sheets where I was. The next day, I asked for & got a blanket since none of the LV hotel beds have comforters on them. Just sheets. On my 2nd trip there, I paid an extra $8 for a Tower room. OMG, I had a beautiful room, lots more space. So MUCH nicer. Night & Day. Definitely worth spending a few extra dollar to up-grade to the Tower.",0

4605,Thomas H,Dec 2014,"I would rate the rooms about a 3 out 5, For sleeping they were fine, seems the noise level was quiet. There were two queen beds in my room, a little work table, the bathroom had a small shelf so if your wife likes to spread her things out that may be a problem with the shower being adequate. Nothing fancy but liveable, I stayed for 5 days and slept well. The one I stayed in was clean and the maid service was good. So not sure what your standards are but I would rate them like a Best Western that was maintained.",0
4605,Sandy H,Dec 2014,"The courtyard rooms are fine. They are clean and neat, they are simply older and haven't been renovated as recently as the tower rooms. Tower rooms cost very little extra and the convenience of staying in the casino, the upgrades, etc. make them a better value in my opinion.",0
4606,PopUpShop,Mar 2015,"Everybody who comes to Las Vegas is going to get hit with a resort fee. Palace Station's fee is lower than many. This helps pay for the water, utilities, etc. The water table in NV is very low, just like California. Shockingly so - go out to Hoover Dam and you'll be stunned at where the high water marks are compared to where the actual water is now. ALL hotels - Holiday Inn's, etc. charge that extra 'room security deposit' that is released after check-out, once they have confirmed you haven't stolen the TV, lamps, pictures, towels/robes, trashed the room OR smoked in a non-smoking room. They have signs in the room spelling out you'll pay a $250 fine/fee to have the room deep-cleaned & repainted if you do smoke in one of the non-smoking rooms. Again, this is pretty standard all over. I have stayed in both the courtyard & tower rooms. As others have said, the Courtyard building is older - it's the original part of the hotel. My room on the 2nd floor in the middle area overlooking the pool was just fine save for no heat in February. Next stay was a Tower up-grade for $8. Had a lovely room. Night & Day difference, IMO. I would always spend the extra $ now and up-grade to a Tower room.",0
4606,step12dude,Aug 2014,"I've stayed at this hotel many times, but always in the towers. The accommodations in the towers have been generally good, although on my most recent visit, the quality seemed to be falling, and the room showed definite signs of wear and tear. I've walked through the courtyard and this is definitely an older section, and, from the public areas, does not impress. If I were you, I'd call the hotel to see whether or not they can tell you where your rooms are confirmed; I know in my case, I've always confirmed tower rooms, so it may be that your rooms are already in a designated section of the hotel. Yes, there is a resort fee, which provides you nothing more than you would be getting from a mid-tier hotel in a non-resort area, and there is a refundable security deposit (I believe it's $100) per room, which is refunded when you leave if there are no lingering charges, damage to the room, or missing items (such as towels and such). As a person who has stayed here multiple times, my assessment is that it's not a *bad* hotel (at least in the tower), but you can usually do better elsewhere in Las Vegas. The coffee shop in the hotel, however, is outstanding - very large portions, good service, and very tasty food - and it's open 24/7.",0
4606,AreWeThereYetPDX,Aug 2014,"We enjoyed our tower room. It was modern, clean and well appointed. We walked through the courtyard portion of the hotel to go to the salon, and I understand why some people are dissatisfied. It was much older and a bit dingy, but it was not scary and there were lots of families around the pool. Having said that, I would spend my money on the tower, and visit the pool. Expect to provide a on time (refundable) deposit of $100 per room, and resort fees of around $17 per day, per room.",0

4606,MarigoldMiss,Aug 2014,"You dont know the exact location of your rooms until you get there. Yes there are both a daily resort fee charged (whether you use the facilities or not) as well as a security deposit put against your credit card. If all goes well you get this deposit back at the end of your stay. As for AAA you would need to contact the hotel directly or check their website. Like I said in my review, I would not stay here again and would not recommend it to other travellers. You might think you've got a great deal in the price, but you get what you pay for!",0

4769,Erika P,May 2019,I guess that will be a personal preference. We like both views. The mountains are beautiful especially in the morning and evenings. But because the pool at the hotel is probably the best in Vegas the garden area around it is also scenic. Keep in mind as the day gets busier more people are at the pool so some of its ‚Äúview‚Äù becomes more of people than pool. Also you don‚Äôt look straight out at the pool but have to look down at it but with the Mountain View you look out at it. So the Mountain View is more of a ‚Äúview‚Äù in my estimation. I don‚Äôt know if this helps your decision or not.,1

It might depend on how busy the Hotel is at any given time- but my experience and stay could not have been any better. I truly enjoyed the whole time I was there, from the room to the dining to the gambling to the service etc. Great Vacation. Premium Experience",0
4785,Josephh3208,Sep 2018,I know you can pay an extra $20 and they wheel a portable mini fridge in for you at other MGM properties. (Sometimes the fee is waived). That may work. I agree with previous responses that due to the sensors they might not accommodate that request. Hope this helps.,2
4785,gurk123,Sep 2018,"Hi. That is something I can't answer, although I lean towards no due the sensors that are in the fridge to bill you when you take out their items for sale. You do get the small top shelf that holds about 4 bottles of water or beer. I would check with the Hotel as to the whole fridge question you ask.",2
4785,KLM1113,Sep 2018,I really doubt they will remove items from the frig as that is the true purpose of having the frig in your room....not for your stuff but their stuff. They even shrink-wrap the coffee cups for the Keurig so they charge you for using the coffee maker. It's Vegas baby...they make their money however they can!,1
4785,Sara P,Sep 2018,They will not do this. However you can have them put a separate fridge in your room for an additional charge.,0

4786,mattmues,Sep 2018,Busy yes. but getting a chair is easy. Place is massive.,1
4786,911ladydi,Sep 2018,"We were there a couple weeks ago. Was a quieter week but lots of chairs by Delano pool and also lots of chairs by wave pool however, those are in the sun. We went down about 11:00. Limited number of chairs by the lazy river. If a busy week or you want shade go early but if an average or slow week you are ok a little later but will be in the sun.",1
4786,amorejnm,Sep 2018,"The Delano, pool is not as busy as the Mandalay Bay ""Beach"" areas. These are right next to one another, however, only Delano guests may use the Delano pool. Though that sounds nice, it depends on what you're looking for. The Delano, pool is just a small basic pool. The Mandalay Bay, beach area is at least 75 times larger, including a lazy river, wave pool, and shallow pool, and another pool. This area is very busy and finding shade is extremely difficult. If you desire a chair in a shaded area I suggest you arrive when the pool area opens- this may be said for obtaining a chair at all really. It also depends on the location of where you prefer to rest. Chairs near the lazy river are near impossible to find as are chairs close to the wave pool. However we found a few chairs with umbrellas for shade in the Mandalay Bay Beach area to the far left. Also, if you desire to use the lazy river, I strongly suggest you purchase a inexpensive tube at a Target, Walmart, on Amazon (since retail seasonal items may be unavailable) or similar store. The resort does not provide them and they no longer rent them. They do however sell them in their shop where you will likely have to wait in line for 45+ minutes, for a price range of $30-50 each. But their lazy river is well done and very relaxing if you have a tube :)",1
4786,KLM1113,Sep 2018,"The pool is not a huge space and it does get very busy. I, however, LOVE this pool as it's NOT a mega experience like everywhere else in Vegas and hopefully it's just adults as this is NOT a kiddie pool. Escape the crazy, but get there before 10 a.m. to reserve your chair. The best experience - rent a cabana. I know it's pricey but so worth it.",1
4786,312newswannabe,Sep 2018,"Yes and yes. The pool exclusively for Delano guests is kinda lame; it‚Äôs essentially just a pool whereas the shared one with Mandalay Bay has a lazy river and wave pool. I‚Äôd suggest getting down there early deciding between either pool area and grab a chair. There are signs everywhere informing of reserving chairs is not allowed, but that‚Äôs bs; people were reserving left and right",1
4787,MB81801,Sep 2018,"Yes, we would get to the pool as soon as it opened. Most chairs were taken by 9:30 - 10:00.",1
4787,keez955,Sep 2018,Not really. It's easier to get chairs there than any other hotel. We've never had a problem for my family of four.,0
4787,KLM1113,Sep 2018,"I would have to say YES as it is a very busy pool as it isn't a huge space. If you are not down by 10 a.m. on a pretty day, do not expect to get chairs. That said, and I know it is expensive, but the cabanas are truly the way to go! You get two lounge chairs, two pool floats, and the use of a cabana all day with a safe, electric outlets to plug your phone in and all-you-can-drink non-alcoholic beverages.",0

To those like us who were looking forward to an all adult pool (believe me we love kids...have 4 of them), this was very disappointing. We ended up going to the main pool and it was more relaxing.",0
4787,KM4321,Sep 2018,"I was there over July 4th weekend and it was over 100 degrees, so the pool was packed. There was not one free chair. It is a great pool, just not to much fun when it is too crowded.",0

4789,amorejnm,Sep 2018,"Hello Catkin! You may book online for four guests and the additional child will not cause you any issue nor be an additional fee. Also you may still cancel within 72 hours when booking. The pools are open in April and heated. You will have a fabulous time! We recently stayed here with kids ages 4 and 1 and had a great time in Vegas! It was my first time and I was pleasantly and very surprised to find that the majority of people visiting Vegas were traveling with children! My husband and I actually took a poll and found that more than 85% of the people we counted over the course of three hours in the evening walking the strip had children with them. My advice to you though is to wear comfortable walkin shoes! We walked more than 10 miles a day! Also, if your children are young and require a stroller, for an abundance of walking bring one! We stayed at three resorts when we visited and we loved the Delano! :) Finally, be prepared, the resorts accommodations are very affordable, for us flights were super cheap, however the food was quite pricey- delicious but a bit pricey for eating out every meal and snack for an average middle class family of four for five days. Example: 2 small pina coladas at the Mandalay Bay Pool $50US. 2 eggs and toast at a cute eatery in the Delano was about $26US. We grabbed to go egg sandwiches from their on site Starbucks for a more economical option. But if you look, you can find deals! We did splurge plenary though :)",2

4789,Randall C,Sep 2018,Dear Catkin in the UK. I called the hotel for you and Jameson told me the following. Book the room for 4 people and you will be fine.

Highly doubt they will allow you to bring in your own lounger/float as they rent those at the lazy river. No beverages or food allowed that isn't purchased at the pool either.

4815,Christipher F,May 2017,"Morning The room will be everything in one space basically. The suite will have a bit more space,perhaps with a table and chairs. We have stayed at Delano and Mandalay Bay. I would recommend Mandalay Bay,its a lovely hotel, it has better restaurants, more bars etc. Delano has the bar etc at the top of the hotel, when we were there in April for 5 days, it was closed the whole time for private functions!!!!!! Stay at Mandalay Bay Hope this helps Chris",1

4818,jonathancN785VO,Feb 2017,The sofa in the living room actually can be used as a sofa bed. I believe they have the option for rollaway beds but you might want to call the front desk to check for the charge per night.,1
4819,A Tripadvisor Member,Feb 2017,I suggest you contact the hotel services. They might be able to help you. You should try Bellagio and the Encore. They had excellent mattresses and pillows.,1

4823,april1114,Jan 2017,"I'd have to say that Delano is a very clean hotel. Our room was very spacious and very clean. And the housekeepers do seem to be in the hallways a lot to clean the rooms and honestly, I've only heard them once when they were cleaning the linked room next to us. Other than that, I had no issue with our stay.",1
4823,Rachel E,Jan 2017,The Delano was very very clean! And I am very picky! You would enjoy staying here!,0
4823,A Tripadvisor Member,Jan 2017,"Well, I complained about a barking dog that disturbed us for 2 evenings and received an apology from the management. Part of it stated that it was a 'pet-friendly"" hotel. Had we known that, we would have booked somewhere else. Of course, since you own a pet the barking shouldn't bother you. As far as the ""cleanly-ness"" goes, our room and the entire Delano hotel was very, very clean and I am a clean-freak (part of the reason we don't have pets). The housekeepers do seem to be in the hallways a lot and make a considerable amount of noise. Perhaps they were taking extra time to clean up after the pets.",0

4826,Patti D,Nov 2016,"It took us approx. 15-20 minutes to walk to the Bellagio fountains, including stairs and crowds. Caesars Palace is beyond that still. I think you would be disappointed given the endurance level required.",1
4826,jackie h,Oct 2016,Yes it's a ways but the Delano is worth staying at and taking an Uber or taxi.,1
4826,Pool_Afficianado,Oct 2016,"It's a bit of a hike. You would need to go up and over the strip a couple of times. You might be better in a center strip hotel, but the Delano's customer service is nine million times better than Caesars. If you want to take transportation from the Delano, download Lyft if you don't have it. Cheaper and nicer than cabs, and it's almost always a friendly local driver with great insider tips for dining, etc.",1
4826,stefanthiel,Oct 2016,"The walk from Delano to mid-Strip takes about 30min (shortcuts through the hotel malls). However, at night the streets are packed with people, so it will take even longer. You may shorten the trip by taking the tram from Mandalay Bay to Excalibur, but certainly not to be recommended for someone with limited mobility.",1
4826,DiAna M,May 2017,"I would never try to walk anywhere in Vegas if you want to get there quickly or easily. Even a hotel ""just across the street"" is a roundabout and long journey. These resorts are massive and walking from one end to another of just one hotel can take 15min. Walking the strip (through the hotels preferably) is really fun but include AMPLE time so you are not rushed. Otherwise we take a Uber/Lyft everywhere. And then it's STILL a hike from drop off to final destination inside the hotels. Enjoy the journey lol!",0
4826,SocietyandCulture,Mar 2017,"Just seeing this question! it is quite a ways if walking is a challenge, but there are cabs to and from hotels for about $10.",0
4826,Laurie D,Oct 2016,For someone with limited mobility it would be a difficult walk. Cabs are plentiful and most drivers are kind and talkative.,0
4827,ArlingtonDavid,Sep 2016,"I agree with Brian. If it's possible, I know they will accommodate you. One other thing to consider. Some of the larger rooms have a very large sofa. It's almost incorrect to call it a sofa because I've never seen anything like it. It is well over 6 feet long and more than the width of a single bed. I know it's not bad sleeping because I have fallen asleep on it and woke up there in the morning. If you can do without a bottom sheet and get them to give you a blanket (I didn't have one), you'd definitely be fine on the ""sofa."" Some rooms, like our last room, have 2 of them. We stayed in the Penthouse Superior Suite. I just checked the website and they have a picture of the huge sofa so you can see what I'm talking about. They also have a floor plan and you can see the sofas. The catch: it says the max guests are 2. You have to get them to allow you more people (which they might do). Good luck!",1
4827,Brian H,Sep 2016,"If you call them I am sure they will accommodate. One of our rooms had two queen beds the other a King, it is this room you would need to ask if they can make a twin.",1
4827,Renee L,Sep 2016,"Im pretty sure no hotel uses single beds. They have 2 queens, where 2 people can sleep per bed. You can also possibly het a ""rollaway"" in some rooms that will igve you an extra bed. Due to fire regualtuons, some rooms dont accomodate rollaways. Call hotel for specifics",1

4832,931n,Jul 2016,Thank you for all the responses,0
4833,Tammy R,Aug 2016,Yes to any of the hotels. After you get your bags head on out the doors & there are shuttles available for roundtrip or one way. Way better than a taxi.,0

I I called them and they were quick to answer the phone and respond with an answer to my question regarding resort fees (they confirmed that they do not charge a resort fee and the main reason I called was because someone in the TripAdvisor forums said that they did even though I knew that was incorrect according to the booking information I read). The point being, I received an answer directly from the hotel rather than relying on what someone, who is not associated with the hotel, wrote in these forums. You have no recourse if you rely on advice from other travelers versus receiving information directly from the hotel.",1

4902,Larry,Sep 2018,Some units have been renovated. Just call the front desk manager and ask. Also Marriott sends a pre check in email where you can make special requests. The staff always tries really hard to grant requests. Also at check in I usually ask about an upgrade. I always ask for a room on a high floor as sometimes you can hear outside noise on the lower floors. It is a beautiful resort and I hope you have an amazing celebrations!,2
4903,A Tripadvisor Member,Aug 2018,Hello. The Website states the large 5th floor pool is heated and they also have spa Jacuzzi's which you could use on cooler days. The nights do get cooler as the city is surrounded by mountains. Very beautiful at Sunset from the Observation Area on the 38th floor Bar and Pool area. I would take a Hoodie Jacket or Sweater for the cool nights During the day in March the average temperature is anywhere from 70 to 85 degrees F I hope this helps and that you have a great trip. You will love it there....,3
4903,Larry,Aug 2018,It can be cold during March. Pools are open. One pool is heated and the second is not. Always call the front deck to double check. The pools are outdoor pools. The older pool is really pretty but cold wind can make it uncomfortable. The newer pool is a little more sheltered from the winds. This is a beautiful resort and you will have an amazing vacation.,2

My family and I took Lyft for our departing flight to the airport and it cost us $11.40. If you take a cab you are paying too much. When you arrive at the airport, you want to take the elevator to the 2nd floor.

The hotel side is very nice and it has a coffee maker. You can request a small refrigerator to make sure you get one. I think the hotel side does have a mini refrigerator.

4910,YaYaYoung,Jul 2018,"Hello there! I didn't utilize a time share. I actually am an owner with another brand, but wanted to try something different and I'd heard such good things about this property so I tried it. There is a decent park system in Nevada. We had a reunion there a few years back, at the park. There are a ton of kid and teen friendly shows. There are also street performers that I'm sure you and the teens will get stuck watching. Take a few dollars for tips. They do it for free. Also, you won't have a problem finding a magic show or tribute show, or Cirque de Soleil for your teens' enjoyment. There is always some sort of sporting event going on. Madame Tusseau's will surely amaze and astound them! Vegas has the Tram, which will provide excellent photo opportunities. Some things to consider: Go over to old Las Vegas. There is a bus tour over there and a beautiful light show (Freemont Street Experience) The Boyz II Men attraction seems like fun. There's the High Roller Observation attraction, in the Promenade at the Lynx. It looks like a ferris wheel, but it's actually 10-person pods that allow you the majestic view of Vegas. Hoover Dam tour. Eiffel Tower Viewing Deck. If I'm not mistaken there are'rides' on top of the Stratosphere. Scariest AND BEST rides I've ever encountered! Hop on - hop off bus tours have become popular. Vegas has one. There are tons of things for kids to do inside the Circus Circus Hotel & Casino. Enjoy the trip!",1

Our kids got it so I don‚Äôt know which site they got it on. The double decker bus is fun and goes to old Las Vegas, also worth seeing. Cool zip line there. The Mob museum in old Las Vegas was also interesting, but we are from New England, so it was very familiar to us. Great place to stay, centrally located and close to everything. Have fun.",1

We no longer have children at home so I can‚Äôt comment on that. I‚Äôm sure that there are many activities that you can do with older children. My husband drove exotic cars at the Las Vegas Speedway and went to Danny Kokers personal car museum. We also saw Barry Manilow, the pop singer and Rich Little, the comedian. We also took a side trip to the Grand Canyon on a tour bus. Lastly, we went to Fremont Street in downtown Las Vegas. (I went shoe shopping on the Las Vegas strip!!)

I watched a movie at the pool, went to game night, exercise classes and much more right at the resort. The mall is right across the street. Bingo! LOL. I don‚Äôt have teens myself but about 10 years ago my family reunion was actually in Vegas. So much to do!

4917,Norman K,May 2018,Thank you all for the advice.,1
4917,orrick541,Jun 2018,Take an Uber!!!!,0
4917,annleem,May 2018,"Yes. You can get a taxi but the ride share options are better and cheaper. A local driver for Lyft or Uber can often answer questions about the area, attractions, restaurants, etc.",0

4919,Zan L,Apr 2018,"No hidden fees. Shuttle to various places. We typically walk to the two story Walgreen's which is about 1/2 block and buy grocery items there. They have a fresh food section, all the regular drug store stuff, and also alcohol. The bistro and grill in the resort are both pretty good. Also food at the pool is fine. There are shuttles to various things, but I never take them.",1

This was the first time I stayed there since I purchased it in 2005. Liked it very much. Lots of activities and the shuttle to Walmart and the outlet mail worked out real well.,0
4919,rheaday,Apr 2018,"Just an extra note if you are using a car, the hotel offers free valet-only parking so you might want to including the cost of tipping in your budget. This was not hidden and clearly stated on the site. We enjoyed our stay there.",0

So if you intend to use it to go to Walmart, sign up early in the morning. You can easily walk to the strip and will be right there by Planet Hollywood.",2
4921,crackles008,Mar 2018,There is a Walgreens very close to the Marriott where you can get a variety of goods but the closest supermarket is quite a few blocks away and best to catch a taxi. The Marriott provides a shuttle to the North Premium Shopping Outlet and Walmart but you are best to contact them directly as I was a guest to the Marriott not a member of staff. The strip is 1.5 blocks away and a quick walk. Easier to go the Miracle Mile shops within Planet Hollywood which is close and has many dining and shopping opportunities on the way to the strip.Craig,2
4922,Victor M,Mar 2018,I think you can do it,0
4923,Clarence C,Mar 2018,I have stayed on the 25th Floor twice with a strip view that was amazing! The other times I have high floors had views of the mountains and watched the planes take off from the airport which was not a very bad view ether looking at the mountains when the sun is setting.,1
4923,BUNNYBOYFLOHIO,Mar 2018,"We were in the Northwest Corner on the 2nd floor and the view was excellent, although if we had been higher I believe we would have had a greater view of the strip. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill in Caesars is really delicious--if southwestern is your taste. Believe it or not, the food served at the Grand Chateau's bar/rest is really good--or at least it was when we were there in September--the pork chop was amazing!",0
4923,ManitouWarren1,Mar 2018,We had the top floor a couple of months ago and the views were amazing. Recommended celeb chef places nearby: Emerils Fish House at MGM and Momofuku across the street.,0

4923,msadler99,Mar 2018,"Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten at Prime, the steakhouse at Bellagio, facing the Bellagio Fountains is top notch. Steaks were top 5 in our book.

4924,Jody R,Feb 2018,We used Uber. it was inexpensive and readily available. regular taxis were 3 times more than Uber.,1
4924,kspeaker,Mar 2018,"It is so easy to walk anywhere on the strip from the hotel and many times faster when the strip is busy and jammed with cars. The hotel does have a separate entrance for UBERS, LYFTS, or taxis so just walking out that door you usually find one driving by. You can also use their bus system that is very easy to understand.",0
4924,Victor M,Feb 2018,"No there is not. The strip is very walkable, so I suggest to just walk and see all the hotels and casinos. There is not much to do anyway outside the strip, unless you order some tours like Grand Canyon.",0
4924,Teach1977,Feb 2018,"No you have to walk to the Monorail. It is not too far to walk to the Convention Center, if the weather co operates. We often use the monorail when we stay at grand Chateau.",0
4924,MJ1266,Feb 2018,It‚Äôs in between two rail lines. It would probably be easier to take a bus. I find the rail system to be of limited use unless you are staying right at a stop and are going to very specific locations. It is also expensive.,0
4925,welltraveledmom2,Feb 2018,"Your best choice in Las Vegas is definitely Uber or Lyft, not a taxi. The longest we ever waited for an Uber was 5 minutes. Super easy to use once you set up the app which you can do before you arrive.",0

They also had lots of activities including exercise classes. There is a Walgreens across from the Timeshare that has some food but Walmart is better.",2
4932,Len D,Jan 2018,"I was only aware of a shuttle to the mall with Walmart in it, perhaps check with Marriott. It is in between two monorail stations, MGM and Bally, 10 mins walk to either I guess - we walked everywhere as this town is dead flat and it is quite central.",2
4932,Daniel H,Jan 2018,"My wife took the shuttle to Walmart and she stated that it does not go anywhere else. There is a train from the airport to the strip and it stops very close to the Marriott. To avoid disinformation on these points, call the concierge. Good luck.",1
4932,pglr,Jan 2018,I believe there is a shuttle to the Fashion Mall (on the strip) as well as to Walmart. The monorail is not very close.,1
4932,jeanne1979,Jan 2018,"We didn't notice a shuttle, but there is a spot at the hotel where you can catch an uber or taxi very easily. Also, this hotel is just a half block off the strip and a very easy walk.",1
4932,Coopersmom0501,Jan 2018,The closest monorail station is at the MGM. And I don‚Äôt know about the shuttle situation because we either walked or took Uber to where we needed to go.,1
4933,Marriott Vacations Worldwide,Dec 2017,The renovation work is anticipated to be completed by March. The roof top pool is smaller than the one on the 5th floor.,0
4933,s-ssal,Dec 2017,The pool on 5th has a lot of kids. The area is bigger than the top floor. Not sure if pools will be open in March,1
4933,AJDynamicDuo,Dec 2017,I wouldn't stay at the Marriott for the pool. The pool isn't that large and the atea around the pool fills up quickly.,0
4933,Mara H,Dec 2017,"Do not pick this hotel for the pool. As a ‚Äúpool girl ‚Äú I was extremely disappointed. It is tiny, like a backyard pool with very little deck for sunbathing. And it was crowded and noisy. I would not consider it a ‚Äúresort ‚Äú pool at all.",0
4933,v8mth,Dec 2017,Previously they had a working relationship with Planet Hollywood to use their pools. Not sure how important this will be in March. If you want to swim then this is less than perfect but if you just want to get wet and splash about it will do the job. As a swimmer I chose not to use the facility. if you have kids they wont care anyway.,0

4934,JPause,Jan 2018,It‚Äôs only a 10 minute walk.,0
4934,Robert G,Dec 2017,It is about a 8 minute easy walk from Marriott‚Äôs Grande Chateau to the MGM. Very easy to get to along the strip. Been there a dozen times to the Grande Chateau. Love the place. Bob,0
4934,Larry P,Dec 2017,Definitely walking distance. Some times the LV Blvd streets are quite crowded to slow you down. Look at the strip layout on the street and I think it is about 3-4 long blocks - LV style.,0

Since each condo is owned by a person at Signature it helps them internally identify the booking. I stayed there two weeks ago and booked through Priceline. They actually let me choose which Tower I wanted when I arrived which was really cool.",0
4946,Babu2773,Sep 2021,"I do not know what the numbers mean either, but I suggest you call the Signature directly and see what the hotel can do for you. We've always found them to be very helpful and accommodating. And most importantly, offer competitive pricing.",0

4947,ReneqJ,Aug 2021,I only stayed in Tower 3. I suppose it depends what would make it the best experience for you. I enjoyed the strip & Mountain Views from my room. It was amazing. There was also more privacy. Good luck with your search.,0
4947,djlehman09,Aug 2021,"I agree with other answers. Tower 1 because they have more access. We stayed in 2 in April and when we booked we were supposed to have access to ALL the pools but once we checked in, we were told we did not and once the pools we were allowed in hit capacity, you didn't have anything. We were at the pools 45 minutes before they opened and they were maxed out within an hour. We weren't allowed to leave or run up to our rooms quick because if someone else came and fill your spot then it was at capacity again. I'd definitely check when booking what you will have access to",0

4957,kendallbeckman,Feb 2020,The walkway is indoors/covered Uber is very easy from tower 2 - out the front door and down a very short driveway @ the roundabout - easier than inside of the parking garage @ MGM which is extremely hot in the summer. Drop off is at front door.,0

4964,RalphDailey,Nov 2019,"Hi - The towers are connected through a covered walkway that is also connected to the MGM hotel, casino and all the shops. One tower is for owners only so that pool is restricted. There is a starbucks in tower 1 and a cafe in tower 2 where you'll have to check in to the hotel part of it. There are lots of Air B&B options there as well that may not include the daily resort fee. So, no you don't have to go outside unless you need to get in a car.",2

4967,cmtbr59,Oct 2019,"Yes Mimsharrison, I agree with other contributors. Uber is the best way to get around. We stayed in tower 3 & we had a balcony looking towards the airport & looking towards the strip. The Signature is not on the strip but a road off it. You can walk between the three towers & on through the Mgm grand to get to the strip. Have a lovely holiday",1
4967,jillwagner,Sep 2019,We use Ubers for airport transfers. There is a ride share pick up area just past taxi stand. If you want a balacony with strip view you just have to request that when you book....costs a bit more.,1
4967,lynna956,Sep 2019,I booked directly with an owner of a penthouse that combined 2 penthouses with views of the strip. Amazing rooms. Amazing balconies. We took a cab from the airport. The Uber pick up was a much longer walk away.,1
4967,Tifevans21,Sep 2019,Uber cost about $10 and they'll take you by a dispensary for free if that's your thing. I uber'd everywhere. As far as strip view balcony I'd call and see if they can handle it for you before you get there because there were no upgrades available when I arrived.,1
4967,Brian W,Sep 2019,Cabs will be readily available. I usually rent a car at the airport though. The airport also packages that will take you to your hotel and pick you up for your departure ( I did that my first visit ). As for a balcony with strip view. You can try the old tipping the person at check in and ask for an upgrade.( You have to cross your fingers ). Or the signature will allow you to pay an extra 10 or 20 per night for a guaranteed strip view.,1
4968,Casey1919,Sep 2019,Tipping is an personal choice. We didn't use the car very much after we started our stay and the Signature so I gave them a very good tip when we left. A rule of thumb is $3-5/ valet use.,0
4968,Casey1919,Sep 2019,We stayed there last fall and the parking was free. They are very professional and took great care of us and our car. We had an early flight out and they were open very early so there was no problem getting to the airport.,0
4968,Marco V,Sep 2019,Parking is free to Gold or Platinum members other members and guest have a daily rate and it should be added at time of booking. And I normally tip $5-$10 depends on the mood,0

4990,Rayzalaff,May 2019,Hi. Weather is normally good this time of the year but evenings may be cool. Pools in the better hotels aren‚Äôt usually busy and there is no need to reserve but have a word with the pool attendant when you arrive as they are normally very helpful. If you want to book any trips go online as they can be full very quickly.,1
4991,Tom T,May 2019,I strongly advise watching Yellow Production's videos on Vegas on YouTube. It's not a plug but he does have some very good advice for the first time visitor. Where the good but cheap food is and the scams to watch out for.,1

4999,Atalltraveller,Mar 2019,"Trick question. If you have paid transportation, like cab or car, you'll want to give them specific tower. Otherwise they'll drop you in Tower 3 - closest to the street. I'd suggest you call Signature and ask them which room and tower you're assigned to the morning of day of arrival. Use this as is if that's ok, otherwise ask for room in your Tower of preference. The Towers are similiar in build but there are a few distinctions. If in summer, and you're not on strip side, WetRepublic party music can be loud in the summer. If you're not ok with that of course ask for a strip side - and tower 2 or 3. If you won't be using MGM facilities at all, going to other places on strip for entertainment, Tower 3 will be just fine. Gym's are in Tower 1 and 3 and there is a eating place (formerly Starbucks) centrally located in Tower 2. Oh, and when you check in, ask for all the place settings (flatware, plates, glasses etc) that you'll want. They no longer keep those in the units like they used to. Have a great time!",1

5005,217jayneh,Mar 2019,"I believe they all have balcony‚Äôs, enjoy!",2
5006,Pookans,Mar 2019,"Hi - You will love the Signature, we stayed there for the first time last year, as we normally stay at The Delano but are going back to the signature again this year. All booked. Its cheaper to book it directly through MGM life we found and then you can also book late check out which is great for UK flights. The towers all have their own pool and you can also use the MGM pool area. We were in tower 1 last year, its great 5 min walk to MGM Casino and restaurant area. Have asked for Tower 1 this year. Try and upgrade to a balcony if you can its lovely. Its really easy to get to the strip from the signature either through MGM or just round the back. The tower pools provide towels, and there were always sunbeds available and they are free. You will have to pay a resort fee as it is not normally included in your holiday so be aware of that. Also if this is your first time, leave loads of room in your case and go to the premium outlets. Easy if you have a car or get a cab from reception. It is so cheap there much cheaper than the miracle mile or other shops on the strip.. loads of great bargains for trainers, jeaners, tops, handbags :) - Enjoy your holiday.",2
5006,Toujo,Feb 2019,"Hi oscarhart, There is no charge for lounge/deck chairs around the pools, however if you wished the use of a private Cabana, then, I understand, a booking is needed and there is a charge. You will really enjoy Signature at MGM Grand and I suggest you request your stay in Tower 1. Tower 1 is closest to the Casino and yet is still a short walk past Towers 2 & 3 to E Harmon Avenue. From E Harmon Avenue you avoid having to go through the Casino and it is a short walk to the main strip that takes you past the entrance to The Miracle Mile Shops where there are heaps of restaurants. We have stayed at Signature on 3 occasions now and we always stay in a 1 Bedroom Suite. Be careful who you book your accommodation through as some websites and private providers do not provide housekeeping. We always book direct via the MGM website, and if you join, which is free, you always get a great price. Enjoy your stay - Toujo",1

The other two times we have stayed we noticed that the bath did not have the spa in it. Would I pay the extra for a Penthouse - NO.",0
5007,ronnjr04,Feb 2019,If you wait there's a chance there are no Penthouses available. So I would put in for the upgrade online or over the phone to guarantee the room. In rare situations they may upgrade you to a better room for the price of the room you've reserved. But that is very rare. Good luck,0

I think I have a few of the views posted on Trip Advisor; anyway, I personally would not pay to be upgraed unless it is a free upgrade due to your membership level. Enjoy. CAB",1
5017,Barendina S,Oct 2018,We were also upgraded to the 31st floor with a balcony and to be honest we went out on it for about 10 minutes. Unless they offer the upgrade in my opinion it's not worth paying extra money when you're hardly in your room at all to begin with and you're not spending all the time you're in your room on the balcony anyways so. Just my opinion,1

Also read the other reviews, you get charged a resort or amenity fee when there are literally no amenities offered. Also the $50 deposit, good luck getting that back. We didn't get ours back and for the life of me couldn't figure out why. When I contacted the hotel they said it was an honest mistake and it would be refunded. After no refund and contacting twice more I gave up.",0
5042,Bill S,Nov 2018,No to cold in winter months. If they gave you a room at this hotel I wouldn't take it. May I suggest go to trip advisor or other on line site and check out different hotel.Sure some downtown would even be cheaper. If you are young and want to party all night stay at Golden Gate.

The shower does have a one way mirror and if the light is on in the room it is a bit subtle but may be embarrassing to your children.

Can't help with the pool question, try posting on the TA Vegas forum, they will be able to. All in all I'd enthusiastically endorse you booking there. Good luck!",0

I found after two trips there that the view to the adjacent alley (off street) was a little quieter but the last time I had a view looking south on the strip. The windows (except the one in the bathroom) shut out most of the noise and the view was worth any I saw. It had no effect on my sleeping, tv viewing or listening to the radio. It's a comfortable hotel room and I don't think you will have any problem.",2

5135,12brad L,Feb 2015,I know that people staying there have had noise problems. Construction at first was one of them. I believe that has abated somewhat. The higher rooms are closer to the nightclub on the roof which tends to quite loud. I think the lower rooms tend to not have this issue. The rooms are on the dark side unless the bulbs are brighter now. Have fun!,0
5136,Simballa87059,Feb 2015,"I agree with the see through mirror. You HAVE TO want to see through it to do so. There is a sliding door (kind of like an exposed pocket door) on smooth rollers that shut off the bathroom from the rest of the room.

It's free anyway, then if you want a traditional experience, walk next door to Flamingo.",0

I'm sure you could get food and drinks but leaving mY cause you to lose your spot. The place is slammed. If I was you and was staying there - grab their amazing breakfast and get up top ASAP at 10am. You get the VIL line as a guest and may be lucky to get a spot. They sell many of the small pools and lounging areas to groups. Go online and you can see the costs on the chart. HAVE FUN.,0

Margaritas are just as expensive as what you would pay in the Mandalay Bay Sportsbook bar or at the Mandalay Beach bar. I was in a party of 3 over Memorial Day weekend (2019) and we would spend all day at the pool. Our total tab each day would range between $100-$150... and we are not heavy drinkers. I still highly recommend the Four Seasons especially if you are planning to spend significant time at the pool. The pool area is exclusive to Four Seasons guests, which tends to keep away young (and loud) children who gravitate to the Mandalay wave pool,anyway. It also has a beautiful atmosphere amid a tropical oasis setting. As mentioned before, the service is incredibly polite and professional. The whole experience is very pleasant and relaxing.",1

Tourists (like ourselves) often look for a common topic of conversation and naturally extreme weather is on everyone's minds. But when the weather is extreme you will have to expect that generators and internal systems in huge buildings may be operating at capacity. (Ditto for extreme cold). 120 is HOT for an external temperature and therefore every system is more stressed.

5351,Christi Carl Galla,Feb 2020,I would look on the schedule of the bus in the las vegas metro area. or ask the front desk they should be able to tell you. You can always go with uber.,0
5351,Joel C,Jan 2020,"Go online (go their website, go to amenities, go to transportation), They have 2 shuttles leaving every 1/2 hour that go to either the Mirage or Tropicana. Pick ups are at the same locations. According to online schedule, they go to Fremont on Tues & Wed. I do not use the shuttle - we drive to Las Vegas, and find it more convenient to travel by car when and where, not relying on the shuttle - you have to do a lot of research, especially regarding parking fees and where there is free parking. We are foodies so we go and drive to all these restaurants that Guy Fieri has been to (can't do that with the shuttle).",0
5351,slb104,Jan 2020,The shuttles were great but be advised that the pickup time‚Äôs on the strip are right on time so if you are running a few minutes late you will miss it. We ended up wanting to go to Fremont street earlier than the shuttle so we took an Uber there and the shuttle back.,0
5351,Relax53276473597,Jan 2020,"The shuttle schedule is visible online (go their website, go to amenities, go to transportation), but is a bit confusing if you haven't ever used it.

5365,Sally C,Jun 2019,Hi there. No. There is a Denny‚Äôs beside the resort and there is a lovely restaurant at the hotel. But you pay for your own. There are kitchen units in the resort guestrooms and a shuttle which takes you to the grocery store so you can prepare your own food. There a beautiful clean bbq‚Äôs outside also.,1

5365,Meri,Jun 2019,It is not a hotel or motel; it is a timeshare that allows non-owners to stay at the resort. Each unit has a kitchen (the Bora-Bora has a full kitchen and the Morea has a mini-kitchen) so you could go to the grocery store and buy food you want to make in your unit (be sure to get coffee filters - the resort provides a couple of one use bags but no filters). This is how we do our timeshare vacations - we shop after we get unpacked and buy meals for the week so we only have to eat dinners out a couple of times per week. The resort also has awesome barbeque areas if you feel like grilling. Just a note - there is a Black Bear Diner down the road to the south about a mile away that has killer breakfasts!,0

5370,Sarah-Ryan1,May 2019,"As others have said, no airport shuttle. One option is to take the shuttle at the airport to the car rental facility (there is one large one for all rental companies) and then walk to Tahiti Village from there. It is a short distance (you can map it but I think it took us less than 10 minutes to walk). If that isn't an option for you due to mobility issues or heavy luggage or something, then Uber is the next best. ;)",0

5373,Cheryle H,Apr 2019,only one bathroom to each suite or room. The toilet and shower share a space. Each room only allows up to 4. you have 2 for the bedroom (which is separate) 2 for a pullout couch (which is open space). If you get two rooms together then you will have 2 bathrooms. The larger full kitchen room has a washer and dryer and a balcony. The smaller room has a mini fridge and microwave and only window is from the bedroom.,1
5374,AKStafford,Apr 2019,"Every time I've taken the shuttle to the car rental facility it's been full. With 30 -40 people all getting off at the same time and with as big as the car rental facility is, I seriously doubt anyone will notice or care.",2
5374,Sarah-Ryan1,Apr 2019,"I agree with the above comment. Nobody will notice or care! The rental car area is huge. It is also true that it is a short walk to Tahiti Village from there (just use Google maps, as when we did this we got a bit turned around). Very easy to do.",1

5382,Dr_Q,Mar 2019,"You mean, like SuperShuttle? Yes, there are several. Just google ""Las Vegas Airport Shuttle."" But it's so close to the airport, you might as well take a cab or ride share, or take the free shuttle to the car rental center and get a cab from there. It's close to mile to walk, because, despite what Google maps says, you have to walk all the way to Las Vegas Blvd, as there is a wall at the back of the property. That's a long way to drag luggage.",0
5382,valmailorraine,Mar 2019,Not one run by the Tahiti. Cheapest way would be catch a ride to car hire centre and ring a taxi from there. The Tahiti would provide you with a taxi number. Tahiti is only a short distance away from the car rental centre.,0

5400,noblemon2,Nov 2018,"Most Las Vegas pools start to close starting in late October, as it does get cold in Vegas. I wouldn't count on the pools being open in November, but the spas might be, as they're heated. I'd call the property before you go. Good luck.",0

5400,Chris N,Oct 2018,Yes the pools are open year round,0
5400,Diane R,Oct 2018,The lazy river is heated and I think the main pool is as well but I'm not sure. We were there in October and the pools were still open.

5400,jerrygunter62,Oct 2018,I'm not sure we stayed there in july but considering the weather in las Vegas I would say probably,0

5402,AKStafford,Oct 2018,Pool towels were available at the pool and lazy river when we visited.,1
5403,April M,Oct 2018,We have stayed in all three towers. If you need shuttle access from tower 5 is the farthest walk to the shuttle. Towers 1 and 2 are the closest. Up high in tower two over looking the pool gives you a good view of the strip. Tower 1 ask for a strip view. It's amazing. We have 3 timeshares here. We love watching the planes take off and land. Which tower 5 is good for that. Also you have to visit the bar/restraunt 17¬∞ degrees booze/bites. David the bartender is wonderful.,2
5404,AKStafford,Sep 2018,"We usually stay in Tower 1 and it has.... 5 floors I think. The first time we stayed we had a ""strip view"" and was on the top floor and could see the strip in the distance. Just know that room assignments are not guaranteed until check-in.",1

But to be honest, we were there in June and even with lots of families there, it wasn‚Äôt crazy loud or bothersome.

By lodging in one of these it also makes parking raiser, as parking is always at a premium.

Look up Las Vegas Scooters, or just Google the question ""where can I rent a scooter near the Golden Gate Hotel Casino in Las Vegas?"" These businesses will deliver free of charge to your hotel. The scootaround option will let you have it for the duration of your stay to go where you will. That's a nice option! I notice they have a charge life so you will need to heed what that is when you book. I think it's so handy. When you stay at the Golden Gate make sure to book a Suite and an accessible one at that.

5550,travelgirl1960,Nov 2017,"I think you answered your own request! I'm amazed by how people do not do their own due diligence. I am Worst Case Scenario Lady. I leave NOTHING to chance. I also am done booking 3rd party reservations (Expedia, Hotwire, etc), because here's what they are: (by the way, I'm in the hospitaity industry) They are a pool of undesirable, hard-to-sell rooms the hotel is often stuck with at the last minute. So they allow the 3rd party to sell that block at a discounted rate, and the hotel pays Expedia a percentage of that rate. This is how Expedia and the like remain in business. They are usually standard rooms in the least desirable location of the hotel. In Vegas, they will be right on top of the construction of the Las Vegas Club site and the bandshell. You can call Expedia all you want and you will not get a preferred location. PLEASE NOTE that if you book a comp room at the Golden Gate you will also get this very same room but you can REQUEST an upgrade, which you will pay for, no $20 trick here. You can request a LOCATION away from Fremont if you want to sleep this trip. Believe it or not, several years back I arrived with my party of 3 after midnight. They'd given our standard room away but gave us the PENTHOUSE, no upcharge. It went for $1K/night. Always call back to confirm your accommodations. Get the name of your reservationist. When you arrive, get a casino host to know who you are and what you hope to do. Get their name and business card. Have them quote you your total including tax, resort fee and deposit. If you have a comp room, you'll not have to pay your resort fee. Make them aware of that, as well. I've had problems here twice now with my bill being wrong from what I knew was supposed to be at check in and it's been fixed for me. Do work ahead of time so you KNOW. And finally, the Golden Gate is not for everyone. It's not the Strip, but it is old, vintage Vegas and I will go there every time, by choice, for what it represents.",1 vote

5574,Eric E,Oct 2015,"Oh, it's absolutely not in the middle of nowhere. It's in the heart of the city in downtown Vegas. It's a relatively short bus ride--about 25 minutes--from the airport. There are also two bus routes that have stops at Freemont and will take you to casinos on the strip. These buses are the Duece and the Strip Express. However, the Strip Express makes a slight detour off the strip and skips a few casinos while on the strip. But to answer your question about safety. There is a huge police presence at the Freemont Street Experience. So, in my opinion it's absolutely safe. Inside Golden Gate I didn't feel uncomfortable and unsafe. To access the elevator to the hotel rooms, you must walk pass the front desk. I'm pretty sure if hotel staff considered someone looking suspiciously, then they would stop and ask questions. I've observed hotel and casino staff clearing out drifters from the street on one occasion. Of course, you need your hotel keycard to access your room. If you don't have a key and request a new one, then you'll have to show ID and give your room number. Casino security has a huge presence on the casino floor. The thing about Freemont Street Experience is that you're going to see weird and wild people, such as street peddlers posing as legitimate street performers. You're going to run into homeless people asking for money. But you'll see that on the strip because Vegas has a big homeless problem. Because I'm a man I never feel threatened in regards to my safety. I can go places alone and walk in certain areas alone without worrying about someone bothering me. But being a woman I would suggest you stick to the heavily lighted general areas of Freemont and downtown Vegas and stay off the back streets and alleys. And yes, there is a Walgreen's within walking distance from Golden Gate. It's about a block away. You're talking about probably no more than a 6 minute walk, if that long. I hope I've helped",2
5574,ZenoSX,Oct 2015,"This is a highly safe area. As long as you stay in the Fremont Street area, there is absolutely nothing to worry about, at any time of the day. However, do not venture much out of this area, as the surrounding locations can be a bit seedy after dark, but during the day they are even fine. There are cheap buses that will take you to the downtown strip and back throughout almost any time of day, and they are Very safe. I have spent at least 3 weeks in Vegas, and I know of others that have spent the equal to months of time in the tourist areas. These area's are 100% SAFE and I would not worry about letting my kid go as long as he/she stayed in the tourist spots :).. Hope this helps!",1
5574,Lynnette2014,Oct 2015,It is a safe area and very populated with security all around. Stay on the main routes and you should be fine. As for Walgreen's I am not sure where or how close one would be. Enjoy.,1
5574,Eric E,Oct 2015,"Just one more thing. Unless you need to go to Walgreen's for prescription medication, I would avoid it because of their prices. There's a nice and clean package store near Golden Gate. There's lots of package stores on Freemont, but I think this one is the best. It's closets to Golden Gate, about one door down.",1
5574,BoClem,Oct 2015,"I agree with everyone else. I only stay downtown. And I have no problem walking around by myself. There are tons of bike cops, and they do a great job maintaining the area. The casinos are very safe and right next to each other, where as the 'strip' hotels, once you go out of one, you are walking along the main streets. Freemont is very safe. Enjoy and take lots of pictures, so your parents will feel good about it the next time you go.",1
5574,bookman1995,Oct 2015,"You've gotten tons of answers so I won't repeat what's already been said, the only thing I would point out is if your parents are expecting a Vegas ""strip hotel"" experience (i.e., close to blue chip properties like Bellagio, Caesars, etc.) then yes, it is ""far away"" insofar as the strip is not the same as downtown, and the average person would take a cab from one location to the other.",1
5574,EZFuentes,Oct 2015,"Fremont street is very safe and full of tourists. There are shops every few blocks, but you might want to do a Google search to fine a Walgreens. It is easier to move around in than the main strip as there are no major intersections to cross. In many ways I perfer Fremont to the main strip.",1
5574,chris w,Oct 2015,It is safe for sure there are police hidden all around the area. Walgreens is on the other end of fremont street maybe a 5 minute walk.,1
5574,Fifoodie,Oct 2015,"Your right. The Golden Gate is right on Freemont St., with the the Fremont Street Experience. It is very safe. Its very busy with tourists all over. Las Vegas has been actively developing downtown and it is much busier and safer than it was even 10 years ago. I'm not sure about a Walgreens proper, but there are many tourist covenience stores that would have a similar selection as Walgreens right in the Freemont Street Experience.",1
5574,Adam M,Oct 2015,The Golden Gate is in a excellent safe location. There is a shop about a 5 minute walk away in the Fremont Street experience area. I am not sure if it is a Walgreens. But it is still within the safe area. I vacation in Vegas alone. I never feel unsafe. Just do not go to the area between the Strip and down past the Stratosphere at night. Bit dodgy. But around the Golden Gate it is safe with plenty of security. Enjoy your vacation.,1
5574,BlondoH,Apr 2017,Is is still considered loud from 8pm until 2pm with the go-go dancers and music? Are these women professionals or shake it like strippers for money?,0
5574,travelgirl1960,Feb 2016,"I stay at the Golden Gate and travel to Vegas alone. It is quite safe. I recommend a room not facing Fremont if you prefer quiet - otherwise the music and action of Fremont is pumping nearly round the clock. I love the Golden Gate. Walgreen's is like 4 blocks down Fremont, an easy walk. I feel more cautious staying on The Strip - I think crime is way elevated down there. The beauty of Fremont is that everything is just right across the street or next door - unlike the deceiving Strip properties, which appear close but can be a major trek. I suggest riding The Deuce, which departs outside of Walgreens, to the Strip. Select an area of the Strip to visit, like maybe The Linq area. Do the High Roller ferris wheel - I suggest the bar car at dusk. Great ride with the most spectacular views of Vegas. Then, take the bus back downtown and relax vs. hiking!",0
5574,ZenoSX,Oct 2015,"Also to further Eric E.'s comment, to get to the Golden Gate rooms, you have to pass through the front desk area, and if you rent a car, etc., the Valet is just outside the front desk area as well. There is only one elevator that I am aware of that goes to the room floors.",0
5575,ZenoSX,Oct 2015,"I do believe Valet is free, but they still expect a tip.. however,, the park yourself lot is only another 100 feet away :) Either way you will be able to park easily and free",0

5575,Eric E,Sep 2015,"Hmmmm. I'm pretty sure valet parking is included in the daily resort fee. However, I'm not sure. I never rent a car when I visit Vegas. I always take the city bus, which has routes that go directly to the airport, travel the strip and deliver me downtown on Freemont Street within walking distance of Golden Gate. The best way to get the correct information is to call the hotel directly.",0
5575,Ydnar,Sep 2015,"I really doubt those parking fees...they want people to play and that would be a definite deterrent. Simply call the hotel and ask, I've never driven, only taken transit.",0

Sams Town, The Rio, Orleans even the hard rock. My son and I got to ride in a limo to the hard rock for free..

5591,Maryann A,Mar 2015,"Important money saving tip! At the airport there are a number of shuttle services, for about $12 to $15 it will take you from the airport right to the door of your hotel. Many taxies will rip you off and charge up to $50 to take you downtown and about $30 for the strip. This is fine if you are sharing the fare. but if you are alone and it's your first trip.

We do have free parking all around our property and every room does come with a DVD player in the living room. Our hotel is completely non-smoking inside, however the one bedroom and deluxe suites both come with a private balcony. You are welcome to smoke out there or in any outside area. The one bedroom suite and deluxe suites are the only rooms that are guaranteed to have a private balcony and are the only rooms that come with a washer dryer in the room. The studio suites, some have balconies and some do not, so we do not guarantee about any. As we assign the rooms on the day of check in, we cannot reserve in advance a studio suite with a balcony. It just depends on the placement of the room in the hotel. While the studio suites do not have a washer dryer in the room, we do have a complementary laundry room on the first floor that you could use if you do go with this room type. The closest supermarket is 1 mile away, whole foods. Please let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to assist.",0

Premium baths have no tubs; from floor to ceiling, the half of the entrance at the shower head and faucets end is covered by a thick glass plate.

5690,Steve W,Jun 2015,"We have stayed there several times in a deluxe room. Can't tell you the difference, but if you call the hotel, they should be able to tell you. It could be the bathroom. The deluxe rooms have a sliding bathroom door that has a slight gap.",0

When I asked the hotel the same question, I was advised the premium rooms have a bath tub, whereas the deluxe rooms don't. I don't think this is correct, as I looked in rooms when walking past and most had tubs. We only paid a couple dollars a day for it so wasn't that bothered. I wouldn't spend a great deal on it. A Fridge costs around $15 per day! Which is ridiculous in this day and age as they generally come as part of the room.",0

Depends on what you like, but I imagine they would have the standard, eggs, pancakes etc. If you have enough points to pay for the buffet, certainly eat there, check out the menu at the entrance of the buffet to see exactly what they serve. Another option is eating across the street at the Rio. They do have the best buffets around. I'm sure their breakfast one has to be phenomenal. If you play there, you might even have points to pay for it. Another option in any of the Caesar's properties is a 24 hr buffet pass for any of their casinos. If you are a good eater, or are married to one, this might work out for you. You could eat at the Rio in the morning, take the free shuttle to Bally's/Paris, eat lunch there, and walk to Harrahs, or Flamingo for evening buffet. Just ask for the pass at any of the buffets, although I don't know the price offhand, but you could go to their website to find out. Have fun!",0

5699,kreeves2,Dec 2014,There is only one tower. I would never pay $200 a night unless you are talking about New Year's Eve then it might get that expensive. I think Mega (who responded to you is right) are you getting the hotels mixed up? Golden Nugget is downtown and Gold Coast if off the strip next to Rio. You can walk to the strip from there but I don't know if I would because you cross over a highway. Golden Nugget is very nice. Gold Coast is okay but old....so is Golden Nugget but it fancier (I think) and it's downtown Vegas which is nice that you can walk to many casino's. You can also ride a bus to the main strip where all the mega hotels are.,1

5702,Kathy V,Jun 2014,Debit cards are fine as long as you have money in the account. If you use a Debit card the funds are taken out immediately for the $100 Security Deposit then put back on your card as long as there is no damage to the room. If you use a credit card there is just a hold put on the account for the amount but funds are not actually withdrawn.,2
5702,Ron L,Jun 2014,"In general debit cards are a bad idea for hotel check-ins. They authorize for an extra amount, per day, on top of the room, tax and resort fee. This would cover meals, drinks, room service or other room charges. Even if you didn't spend a cent extra during your stay that hold stays on for as long as seven days. One buddy used his debit card at the Quad last year for a seven night stay. They emptied his bank account, not deliberately they claimed. Kept charging him over and over! He was dissatisfied with the first disgusting room so they gave him another, then another then a fourth until he gave up. He noticed the funds were gone when he went to those machines that pay out in Vegas, the ATM's, and his bank account was overdrawn. The Quad said there was nothing they could do and that it was CET Accounting that would make him whole in a couple weeks. Meanwhile he had checks bouncing. After threatening to get an attorney he got his funds restored in 48 hours, over $6000, but his vacation was ruined. Never, ever, give a hotel a debit card. If you don't have a credit card, pay cash up front but you won't be able to charge to the room. Small inconvenience for peace of mind.",2
5702,Staci J,Jun 2014,Yes but they will deduct it from your account.,1
5702,Thomas W,Jun 2014,I always use credit cards over debit cards because if there is an issue about being over charged you do not have your own money tied up in a dispute. That is one reason I prefer credit cards over debit cards,0
5702,Lddogg,Jun 2014,"Most properties take debit cards but, since a deposit is required, make sure you have an adequate balance to cover it. If no additional charges are incurred, the amount will not be processed.",0
5702,Louis C,Jun 2014,I have to agree with the rest of the Travelers. DO NOT USE A DEBIT Card. Get a cash advance. The hotel will take out more than you plan and you are on the hook for any mess ups. It could take 60 days to fix it. Cash or Credit Card.,-1

At least when I was there, there's a schedule to go to the strip. But airport pick ups and drop offs were always their priorities. If their policy has indeed changed and they only do airport rounds, I would suggest that you either ask the front desk to call a taxi for you, or if you want to go the strip, take the hotel shuttle to the airport and take another shuttle, don't quite recall maybe supershuttle, to go to a hotel of your choice on the strip. Taking a taxi to the strip is probably a faster way to go, but quite expensive, the airport then shuttle route is cheaper but takes more time. Your call.

I booked two rooms at different times of the day same size same weekends but one was more points that the other when I called they told me one was for a higher floor and the other regular being below 39. You do pay more for higher floors. We had to go with the lower floor since it was 3 families we wanted to be on same floor. Of course when you check in and it‚Äôs available they will accommodate you.,0
5772,Kwasivi,Jan 2021,"This is a question best directed to the management at the Elara, as I do not have information as to premium fees for upper floors. However, I have been advised by other sources that upper floors are typically reserved for Elara time-share owners. My recommendation will be to give the Front Desk a quick call (well in advance of your arrival date) and to request a higher floor (39th to 52nd floor), and to inquire if this reservation would require a premium. I hope this information is helpful?",0
5772,7Rudy,Jan 2021,"When I booked the room using my points, they gave me the 55th floor. All I can recommend is that you put it in the notes section that you prefer a higher floor.

5857,Jose de Jesus A,Sep 2016,It may not be the best place to stay but it is decent place. If you are in a budget then this is the place to stay.

I think that their basic two room suite is the way to go...",2
5857,Steve112975,Sep 2016,We did we were there from August 10th to the 15th. I posted a picture of the pealing jacuzzi. The place is dated and could use a bunch of upgrading. It is ok just not a grand place. It's a place to rest your head. The pools were nice but you will not be using them in December.,2
5857,johnfD8600OC,Sep 2016,"We stayed here in August. We only stayed here because the convention we were attending was being held there and it was a complete take over and the convenience of not having to travel back and forth was worth it. We stayed in one of their regular rooms. But we had friends staying in some of the suites and they all seemed happy with them. With the exception of the rugs which looked clean but in fact cause the bottoms of our feet to get dirty (which is mentioned here in other posts) the rooms did not smell bad at all, bedding while a bit worn was clean and the beds were comfortable. And the overall appearance of the rooms were clean including the bathroom. Everything is relative to what you are paying and what you are used to. If you are used to staying in one of the major Casinos then you are most likely going to be disappointed. But unless you are getting comped for the rooms you are going to pay MUCH more for a suite at the Casinos. Overall since we do get Casino comps we would not stay there again, but if we there was a convention being held there we would probably stay there again for the convenience. BTW it is right across the street from the Hard Rock which is convenient if you do want to gamble.",1
5857,Nana m,Sep 2016,"We stay here and have never had an issue. We will back for two months in December again. Yes sometimes there is a problem because they are remodelling over time. If you want to pay 200-500$ a night for a 5 star luxury hotel there are many to choose from, in fact at Christmas and New years you will pay as much as 500$ a night for New years eve night, so it is all dependent on your budget, your needs and wants. The rooms are clean, safe and the staff are friendly. But its not the Bellagio. As far as the jacuzzi....I would NEVER use one even in the best of suites..they can carry the HPV virus, you should know that. I get sick when I see families allowing their children especially girls use them in hotels with pools and hot tubs. Never use them if you are a female....Enjoy your stay.",1

5859,roxane69,May 2016,"HI,, as a female alone I would not walk to the strip and back at night, alone. Even though there is traffic etc , from the Alexis park we didn't see that many people walking, Remember there is the hotel shuttle bus that goes hourly and drops you at Planet Hollywood, the last bus back from PH is 11pm I think, only need to ring and they pick up. also as the Alexis is across the road from Hard rock Caf√© and hotel you can get there shuttle back too. not sure what there times are,,, after spending 12 days in this hotel I would advise to get the shuttle in to PH. and shuttle or taxi back... would not walk. Shuttle is only a donation (if you want) and taxi not expensive as short distance.",1

There is a taxi stand outside the airport, and we took a cab from the airport for about $35, including tip. We took the shuttle up to The Strip for a concert at Caesar's Palace, but took a cab back because we didn't want to wait an hour until the next shuttle. I think that was about $30, including tip. On the morning we checked out, we called the valet desk and asked them to have a cab for us at a certain time. They were prompt and called our room about 5 min before our stated time. That ride was another $35, and we were dropped off in front of our airline's entrance at the airport.",1

5921,DJOMCSE,Dec 2017,"Archie is correct, depending on your idea of a block. It's quite a walk to anything around there. My suggestion is to rent a car if you want to move around the city. I always do, mainly because I like to come and go as I please. Also, I don't know the neighborhoods that well off the strip, so I feel safer in a car than walking anywhere, especially on Boulder Highway. On another note, Sam's Town has food 24/7 if you're hungry. They have some good places to eat. I suggest looking at Google Maps and seeing what you might be interested in checking out.",0
5921,ArchieMYL,Nov 2017,"Depends on what type of shopping and restaurants you're looking for as well as how far you can walk. For basic needs there is a Walmart close by. If you're thinking about a mall, nope. Restaurants, again a few basic chain restaurants and fast food. Eastside Cannery Hotel/Casino is about a block south with a 24-hour diner as well as an upscale steakhouse. About a block north is Arizona Charley's with a few restaurants.

It's been awhile since I paid attention, but I think minimums can be as low as $2, varying with how busy the tables are etc. There are also free ""dice"" instructional sessions, I think on Fridays. The players' club could likely tell you about that. Sams gets very busy with the rodeo, the auto races, big wrestling matches etc.....probably not the best atmosphere to learn then. Good luck.",1

The rooms are wonderfully spacious. The rooms were recently renovated and 1/2 have roll-in showers the other half have a tub with a bench. Please Remember to Ask For A Roll-In Shower when making your Reservations!! This is a MJST because many people use them and are not disabled, but like the spacious rooms. It stinks, but they cannot ask what their disability is, so be sure to ask for the accessibility you need. If you need something, they will get it for you. The beds were too high for me so they brought a lower bed~no problem. I must use an electric wheelchair so accessibility is important to me. So make your Reservation as Far in Advance as Possible and Tell them Again You Need A Roll-In Shower. They will tell you when you book the room is there is one available.",1

5965,Dewanda56,Oct 2015,"Never had the driver ask if I was a hotel guest. Been going to Samstown for almost 20 years. In fact going tomorrow and staying until Sunday. And I live in the Atlanta area. When you check in at the front desk, ask for a shuttle schedule. Or walk out the back door by the food court beside McDonald's and you will notice the shuttle schedule posted on the wall to your right. Since the shuttle stops running around 10 pm or so, consider using it to the strip and downtown and if you stay past 10, catch a cab back or the public bus system. Short but to the point, the shuttle bus is free and no one will ask if you are a guest. The shuttle is a contractor paid for by Boyd Gaming and people use it to get from the strip or downtown to gamble at Samstown and return to wherever they are staying at. Or vice versa from guests at Samstown . Works both ways. One other tip for Samstown guest. The McDonald's is open 24 hours and always has food specials. Plus if you are a newspaper reader as I am,, the local paper (Las Vegas Review) is sold from behind the counter at a reduced rate daily. Sunday edition is almost half price. Catch you a paper, some coffee and walk out by the park/ waterfall and spend an hour reading in a beautiful place. Plus you might save some money away from the slot machinesüòÄ Hope this helps and have a good stay!",2

The cost of r/t cab fare to and from the airport, the 24 or 72-hour city bus passes, and the time lost waiting for the free shuttle to and from Sam's Town made a rental car the better option for us. We go to shows as well, and it's nice to drive right there without getting sweaty waiting for buses, etc. You can drive from Sam's Town to downtown in 12 minutes. If you book a rental car well in advance, you can get rates at $15-$17 a day from Dollar or Firefly. Just wanted to throw that out there. Have a nice trip.",1

5985,BrianJonestown,Dec 2014,"As others say, Sam's Town really does have a lot to offer. This is where the locals go, however, it depends what you like. We've been going to Vegas for years but we now do a separate annual trip (family and friends) to Sam's Town. We are going in Feb '15 and this will be our 7th time. It's simple and friendly and unpretentious. The slots are better than on the Strip. The tables (particularly craps) are friendly and inviting and fun. They also have live Keno and a poker room. The Sportsbook is massive and caters for every taste and the bingo goes from 9am until 11pm. If you enjoy gambling there's something here for everyone. They have Billy Bob's Restaurant (great steak!), TGI Fridays, Dunkin Donuts, the Sports Cafe and what appears to be a busy Buffet (never been). The bars are cheap and there are always drinks offers. Bowling Alley, cinema, Walmart right across the street, gas station and banks just around the corner and shuttle buses to Fremont Street. They do what they do very well.",0

It's on the south eastern side of town so closer to the way to the Grand Canyon than being in other parts of town. But the Grand Canyon is a several hour drive. However, if you mean the Red Rock Canyon, that I don't know about as I've never been. I liked Sam's Town but as I say in my review, prices get changed and there are hidden costs you might not be aware of. That said, for people who don't gamble, having a bowling alley, indoor ""park,"" a pool table inside one of the restaurants and a movie theatre are all nice pluses.

Haven't eaten there but drinks are about average. I would think it would be equal to other hotels in town, probably $15 plus tip. I would expect to spend $25 for lunch and $40 for dinner per person, based on what I've seen during my 4 visits. But again, I've not eaten there.",-1

When I told him about what happened when we took the shuttle he said that not allowing a handicapped person with a cane to use the ramp entrance on the shuttle's handicapped entrance is discriminatory. It should not have happened and the driver should help the person with a cane board via the ramp. Mr. Wood said that the first step on the shuttle is very high for anyone with a disability and that is why we have a ramp. Just ask the driver to let you use the ramp entrance and he will.,0

6071,Ann B,Oct 2015,My husband and I are also seniors and it's one of the questions I always have when booking a hotel. Yes Tahiti certainly does have more than one elevator. However if you leave togged your car in the lots on the side or back there are a few steps (maybe 4 to six) to negotiate but a ramp is also there depending upon which is more accessible to you.,0
6071,Scienceonseven,Jul 2015,There are many first floor rooms. In fact I was very pregnant with twins during our stay and asked for a room on the first floor to make things easier and more accessible. There does happen to be an elevator.

The condos were well equipped and clean, and the location, about a mile from the Strip, was just far enough to get you away from the crowded and extremely bust Strip. We have been in most of the hotels and casinos over the past 5 years, and a number still pump chemicals into the facilities to dampen the smoke smell.

6079,Soleil Management,Jan 2015,"Hi, Dee-Roe 1. Thank you for your question. Tahiti Vacation Club does not have high-rise guest towers and therefore limited guest units with Strip views. We do have a few, however, and they are all deluxe suites. Frankly, they do not offer ideal Strip views if that's what's important to you. We would recommend staying on an upper floor, which would give you the best view. We would hasten to add that we do not guarantee specific room types. Guest units are assigned at check-in and based on availability. You can, however, request an upper-floor deluxe room with a Strip view on your reservation to give yourself the best chance of obtaining one. In case you're referring to Tahiti Village, our sister resort, we can tell you it does have high-rise guest towers with excellent Strip views. Again, no room guarantees but you can request a Strip view on your reservation. We hope this helps!",0
6079,PSalemSutton,Jan 2015,We didn't have a strip view room. I wouldn't expect a view from the Tahiti as it is a two story facility and not that close to the main strip.,0
6079,ArthurItisinspades,Jan 2015,"There are no towers. There are two three floor buildings in which the inner condos overlook the pool. The outer rooms have very limited views of the Strip because the Tahiti Vacation Club is located on Flamingo about one mile off the strip. You can see some of the hotels from the Tahiti, but there really isn't a great view of the Strip. You might be thinking about the other Tahiti Village located south of the airport on Las Vegas Boulevard, but there's not much of a view of the Strip from that location due to it being farther south. If you want a view of the Strip, take the shuttle bus or rent a car. The car is the way to go because parking is free at all the hotels, and you don't have to worry about a bus schedule and crowded conditions.",0
6080,Soleil Management,Nov 2014,"Hello, ohscrewit. As another responder mentioned, the lobby does not connect to the rooms. You can, however, request rooms that are in close proximity to the lobby.

I don't know if the Tahiti provides ""loaner"" wheelchairs but that would also be an option. We didn't really need to go to the lobby although they do provide a continental type breakfast but we had food in our room so we only went one time to check it out. Did eat the fruit. If you are driving consider a light weight type wheel chair. If flying perhaps the Tahiti can accommodate the need for a wheel chair.",1
6080,A Tripadvisor Member,Nov 2014,"It really depends on the location of your room. If you contact the hotel, I'm sure they can accommodate you. Give them advanced notice, though.",0
6080,Sissey1999,Nov 2014,Depends on where your to .you don't have to go through the lobby to get to your rooms for there are side doors where you park and then there are elevators. It's a great place to visit that's forsure and they are very accommodating too.,0
6080,Raroach,Nov 2014,Guess that depends on where the room is but I think it will be a little walk. But why does she have to go to the lobby? I went there to check in and out and to much more. Get a room near an exit to the parking lot.,0
6080,PSalemSutton,Nov 2014,There is a little walk depending on where your room is. I would specify that you need a room close to the lobby. We just took elevator down and walked outside and entered back lobby door.,0

We parked a car in the lot with no problems at all, there is also a parking structure but we did not use it. We saw a lot of police cars driving through the parking lot and at first were concerned because we frequently saw police cars parked in the lot and thought there was trouble - then realized they were on meal breaks and eating there (we did enjoy the food at all of the restaurants). We saw homeless people on some of the busier streets, but not on the street where Ellis Island is, since it is a little off the main drag. We had NO issues with the homeless at all, they were there with cups, signs, etc. but none even spoke to us, let alone approached us.

Use local american drivers where possible and some of the recently arrived drivers were so bad I had to enter our destination into their sat nav,1
6165,Jeff H,Dec 2015,"I rented a car while there, you can visit the other station casinos in the area plus the strip. Although stated in another posting, there is no charge for parking at most of the casinos, so do require valuation, but that's mainly on downtown Fremont or during special events. Do note - plan to walk a ways as almost all parking is located behind the casinos and require you to walk through the full casino to get to the strip. But of course you'll be doing a good bit of walking on the strip too!",1
6165,796lindac591,Dec 2015,"About 3 miles. Use Google maps it will show you, I hope this answer helped",0
6165,QwnTut,Dec 2015,"It's about 7-8 miles. I'd take a taxi from the hotel and then use the shuttle offered by strip hotels. It's not really worth it to rent a car if you are going to hang around the strip. Most of the other hotels charge a fee to park if you're staying at them. So, spend some time and do the math. Is it worth it to have a car rental/gas/parking for the time you're going to be there or is it more cost effective to use a taxi and shuttle. Either way, you're on vacation aren't you? Have a good time!",0
6165,sylvie b,Dec 2015,"It's about 7 miles from the stip. You can take the bus but if you want to walk all day and come back to change and go out, you will waste a lot of time. Renting a car is the best and you can park free to any hotels at the strip.",0

The location is just a bit west of the strip and directly across from In and Out Burger! Our room at the Days Inn wild wild west was clean and perfect location for the convention we attend each year.

6183,CalMur2,May 2016,"By Federal Law hotels are required to have handicap access. Those rooms typically include a restroom with wheelchair access to the toilet and shower. They also typically include a shower which has a pull-down bench for people to use who have mobility issues. Myself, I spent 6 months in a wheelchair when I split my femur a long time ago, so I don't ask for those rooms, I leave them for people who are in wheelchairs. Instead of asking for a handicap room, ask for ""Down and out."" That is trade talk for ""Downstairs with access directly to the outside. Also add, as I do, ""I have difficulty going upstairs, but I have greater difficulty going down stairs."" This should imply to a clerk, ""You don't want me falling down your stairs."" But please, if you're only moderately disabled (I have a total knee replacement) don't ask for the handicap rooms, leave them for people who are confined to wheelchairs, please.",0
6183,Chuck Brooks,Oct 2015,"Yes, I agree with the previous answer.",0
6183,kdeniker,Oct 2015,Yes. The rooms are accessed from the outside and they have a first floor that allows easy access. Make sure you request the handicapped ones on the first floor. The area is relatively flat with small curbs that can easily be maneuvered over.,0

6188,RafaelSB83,Jun 2014,I drove from California. It's on the same street as the airport. It took me about 5 to 10 minutes to drive to the airport depending on the time of day you drive from the airport. Taxi will cost you any where from $20 to $30.,0
6188,ajfred,Jun 2014,"It is not far, maybe 5 or 6 miles. However, a taxi would usually want to drive up the strip which takes time and adds cost to the trip. Unless you want to sightsee this way, the best way is to have the driver take Interstate 15 north from the airport, about a 10 minute ride. I imagine it would be about $20 as the other person told you. I had a rental car myself. Many of the motels have free shuttles to the airport and back, I don't believe this one does. If you wanted to take the city bus, it would be a pain especially with luggage. Also, you'd have to change buses at least once on the busy street (Tropicana) The Day's Inn is directly across the freeway (I-15) from Excalibur and Luxor.",0

Try Google maps.",1

But now they have cleaned up Vegas alot, lots of new bldgs, and lots of security so no homeless sleeping near the casinos. We usually end the night by walking thru Planet Hollywood (old Alladin), and cross the street there, and it is only about a block from Carriage House, and you must use your Room Key to enter the bldg during the night (after 10:00 I think). and there is security guard on duty 24 hrs a day. Very safe.",0

6258,dennislee52,Jan 2016,The pool is heated and open year round. Just remember you have to walk outside across the driveway to get to the pool area and although the pool sits down behind a tall building on the west it can still be a bit windy.,0

6259,bsaylor1,Jan 2016,"Let me try these. The miracle mile at Planet Hollywood is a block away. Any and all kinds of food,shops,liquor store. There are also a multitude of places nearby. You'll be doing a lot of walking anyway. We love to get a sidewalk seat at Fatburger's Bar and people watch as we eat. As others said, Walgreens isn't that far for some groceries. Depending how long you are staying and your need for grocery, you can place an order with Von's on line and have it delivered on your arrival day. That's quick and easy. Walgreens isn't far until you're lugging a couple grocery bags and two six packs. There is no shuttle service. You can grab an airport shuttle at ground transportation for about 8-11 dollars a person. The front desk will book one for you when you leave. The concierge will get you a car if you want one. We never found the need. There's plenty in walking distance and the ""deuce"" stops almost anywhere you'd want to do. A three day pass is 20 dollars. See Pam,the concierge, when you arrive. She'll guide you to any activity you want and has good ticket prices as well as seating. Enjoy. We love The Carriage House.",1
6259,Phoebe64,Jan 2016,Not sure about the hotel being able to rent a car but we used enterprise as they will come get you The strip is so close to the Carriage House you could walk to any restaurants. Or get a few groceries and make your own breakfast Walgreens has some food and they are close to the Carrage House or if you have a rental car just get all your groceries at any Walmart or grocery store just off the strip. As for the ride from the airport taking a cab is the BEST option. The hotel doesn't have a shuttle and don't pay for a private shuttle. You'll stop at numerous hotels on your way and waste so much time. The airport is so close to the strip the cab will only cost about $20,0
6259,Marcella T,Jan 2016,Looks like your questions have been answered! The concierge in the lobby is amazingly helpful as well!! The entrance to The Miracle Mile is a block away! The Walgreens there is bigger than the typical Walgreens with a lot of groceries. I second another member's recc to eat at FATBURGERs!!! My hubby has been trying to duplicate it at home to no avail! Have FUN!!!,0
6259,Maria K,Jan 2016,"Hi,there are plenty of places to eat and shop for groceries around the hotel just 5 to 10 minutes walk As for the shuttle service I am not sure,but as car rental goes your best option is to rent at the airport as you can get super deals. We were given a brand new Camaro when our first car was not to our satisfaction!! Enjoy Las Vegas Maria",0
6259,David S,Jan 2016,It's a five minute or so walk to numerous restaurants. I'm not aware of a grocery store withing walking distance. Taxis are plentiful to get to and from the airport. You could easily take a taxi or Uber to and from a grocery store.,0

6325,lbdsdraper,Aug 2017,It is shaded in the afternoon,0
6325,Steven M,Aug 2017,Hi It's small and yes shaded often by the buildings. If the pool is important stay and one of the nearby resorts like the Wynn or Venetian. They have amazing pools. Renaissance is more of a business property vs leisure.,0

6325,Ron L,Aug 2017,"As others say it is shaded most of the day as it is in the courtyard. They have instituted a daily fee for parking and internet now.

If you are looking for inexpensive, we have stayed at the Excalibur for a very low cost and it is on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Tropicana, the perfect location.

If you're walking out of the hotel, make a left on Paradise to the Westgate, then make a right on the side street; this will put you in front of Circus Circus which is on the north end of the strip. Or you can walk from the hotel to Paradise and make a right, walk 2 blocks to the SDX/Deuce bus stop and purchase an unlimited 3-day pass for, I think we paid, $24 per ticket. The SDX bus makes numerous stops on the strip, but stops at midnight. The Deuce bus runs 24/7, but doesn't drop you off by the hotel when you're returning; it'll drop you off down the street from Circus Circus and you'll have to walk the 3-4 blocks back to the Hilton. Keep in mind that it's quite a walk late at night when you've been out all day and tired. Personally, I'd get the bus pass and that way you'll know that you don't have to walk more than a couple of blocks. I hope this helps in your decision.

6387,Dave B,Feb 2016,"Since you booked thru Expedia, it is difficult to know without information on the way that your package was put together. However, I am not aware of HGVC offering any package that includes breakfast except for packages that are offered for a very low price for two or three nights contingent on your attending a 30, 60, or 90 minute sales pitch on buying an HGVC membership. That breakfast usually consists of a Danish or other pastry along with coffee and juice. That's pretty much it, although one can probably have more than one roll and a refill on juice or coffee. You get the breakfast when you arrive for your pre-assigned tour/sales meeting and you get to eat it while you are waiting for your assigned sales agent to sit down with you. So if your package was one of those then that is how the breakfast is likely to be structured. If not, then I have no idea. However, I should add that if it (your package) is a sales package, you really do not have a choice on attending/not attending the breakfast/sales pitch. If you miss it, they can and will charge you the full regular price for each night. I hope that this is helpful to you. Good luck.",0

6420,HiltonGrandVacations,Oct 2014,It depends on how important being on the strip actually matters to you. Hilton Grand Vacations - Convention Center is a short monorail ride to the strip.,0
6420,Ricki21,Oct 2014,We are HGVC owners of 15+ yrs and have stayed here at the LV Convention Center site many times (as recently as 2 wks ago). The staff is very nice especially in the deli. It had recently been renovated so the room was clean and neat. The only drawback we had was a really noisy family (crying babies) was put next to us the last night even though we requested a quiet room & the place wasn't even a third full. We have used the monorail and can get daily or weekly passes but we usually have a rental car while there. Most of the hotels have parking garages and it's free. It is a much quieter location than the Flamingo as is the other HGVC site (The Boulevard) on the strip across from the SLS (old Sahara). If you are an HGVC owner there is also the HGVC at Trump Int which I haven't stayed in but have heard good things about. All in all you are very brave to stay in Vegas for 2 wks!!!!,1
6420,Rich P,Oct 2014,"I've not stayed at the Flamingo but If quiet is your priority, the Hilton Grand Vacations Suites meets the requirement. You pay for the tranquility by being a bit more distant from the ""action"".",1
6420,Michael R,Oct 2014,"I stayed at the Flamingo many years ago. I tried the HGVC convention center to be off the strip. it was clean, quiet and the staff was great. No Gambling, but the pool was wonderful and quiet. I would definitely keep this place in consideration for my next trip.",1
6420,Palmtreeslover,Oct 2014,If you are already tired of the vegas commotion then Hiltons Grand Convention Suites is a sure bet. Guaranteed peace and quiet within minutes of the strip. The monorail is nearby . The drive is a breeze and with free parking at all the casinos it is a win win situation. The suites are all modern with every convenience needed. The staff is super. I am sure once you experience a stay there that it will become your go to place on every visit.,1
6420,Bruce T,Oct 2014,"Over the past 4 years I have used the Flamigo and Convention Center properties for business & personal trips. Each has it's own appeal but I agree with your assessment: the Flamingo property is more dated and noisier. In my opinion, Hilton should not allow one of their HGVC properties to become so ""used and ratty"" in appearance. However the noise comes with the location...one block off the strip. The Convention center property is more removed from the 24 hour Vegas noise & therefore quieter. It is still close to the action with the strip tram northern terminus only a few minutes walk. So you can hit all the shows & fine dining...returning to a quiet respite, including a Bar-B-Que court and pristine pool area. My bottom line: If you like living and sleeping in the ""Vegas action"", choose Flamingo. If you like the Vegas fun but appreciate the ability to relax in quiet and sleep in peace, choose Convention Center.",1

6420,joscott58,Jan 2015,"I loved the convention center hilton it was quiet and at the deli you can get starbucks hot coffee or snacks.

There are sidewalks the whole way, but it‚Äôs not a path many people take. I walked to the Aria buffet and it took me about 10-15 minutes. Figure an extra 5-10 minutes to TMobile based on your walking speed.

A better option would be to take to twice-hourly free shuttle between the Hilton Hotel and the Aria, a 10-minute ride. This will take you to the Strip side and an easier walk to the Arena - allow at last 20 minutes to get to the Arena from there. To 'book' the Shuttle, let the Hotel Front Desk know 10 minutes in advance - the shuttle should depart on 00 and 30 o'clock. FYI, Uber was pretty easy to book, going from the Hilton to the Strip venues. Hope this helps.",0

Or there is simple places like a dollar tree which is close to the party city (@ 4055 S Maryland Pkwy). For a cake there is an Albertsons about 15 minutes away or one of the many bakeries in the hotels. Carlos bakery from the Cake Boss show is in the venitan. If you don't plan on having a vehcile I recommend Uber for everything. It was cheaper than a taxi and were there always is less than 5 minutes. Hopefully that helps.,1

6592,ArthurItisinspades,Feb 2015,"My wife and I spent a week at the Tahiti the last week of October 2014, and we didn't notice any odor that was overwhelming or offensive. The condos were well equipped and clean, and the location, about a mile from the Strip, was just far enough to get you away from the crowded and extremely bust Strip. We have been in most of the hotels and casinos over the past 5 years, and a number still pump chemicals into the facilities to dampen the smoke smell. Some are stronger than others, and it's impossible to please everyone's sense of smell.",0

It makes alternating hourly trips to the Mirage and the Tropicana. We do not provide airport shuttle service. Thank you for your inquiry.",1
6595,Soleil Management,Jan 2015,"Hi, Dee-Roe 1. Thank you for your question. Tahiti Vacation Club does not have high-rise guest towers and therefore limited guest units with Strip views. We do have a few, however, and they are all deluxe suites. Frankly, they do not offer ideal Strip views if that's what's important to you. We would recommend staying on an upper floor, which would give you the best view. We would hasten to add that we do not guarantee specific room types. Guest units are assigned at check-in and based on availability. You can, however, request an upper-floor deluxe room with a Strip view on your reservation to give yourself the best chance of obtaining one. In case you're referring to Tahiti Village, our sister resort, we can tell you it does have high-rise guest towers with excellent Strip views. Again, no room guarantees but you can request a Strip view on your reservation. We hope this helps!",0
6595,PSalemSutton,Jan 2015,We didn't have a strip view room. I wouldn't expect a view from the Tahiti as it is a two story facility and not that close to the main strip.,0
6595,ArthurItisinspades,Jan 2015,"There are no towers. There are two three floor buildings in which the inner condos overlook the pool. The outer rooms have very limited views of the Strip because the Tahiti Vacation Club is located on Flamingo about one mile off the strip. You can see some of the hotels from the Tahiti, but there really isn't a great view of the Strip. You might be thinking about the other Tahiti Village located south of the airport on Las Vegas Boulevard, but there's not much of a view of the Strip from that location due to it being farther south. If you want a view of the Strip, take the shuttle bus or rent a car. The car is the way to go because parking is free at all the hotels, and you don't have to worry about a bus schedule and crowded conditions.",0
6596,Soleil Management,Nov 2014,"Hello, ohscrewit. As another responder mentioned, the lobby does not connect to the rooms. You can, however, request rooms that are in close proximity to the lobby.

6598,Tana50,Oct 2014,"I am not sure how to respond as I don't know what the Tahiti Village is actually being compared to? If comparing to the newer Tahiti on LV boulveard I can only say that we prefer the ""older"" Tahiti on Tropicana Ave for several reasons. Quieter for starters, pools stay open year round and we prefer being a bit away from the strip. Our friends who are owners did like the lazy river at the newer Tahiti which is a much larger property.",0

6652,mmg22153,Jan 2020,The resort only offers shuttle service within the resort AND to specific places on the strip at scheduled times. We were able to walk from the resort to the strip and when we got tired we took Uber which was generally around $8.00 for 3.,0

6652,K M,Jan 2020,The cost will vary depending on peak times/busy hours and size of vehicle when riding with uber/lyft. We used uber but we were a family of 5 using uber XL which costs more. One time it costed us $23 (9am) another time was $38 (5pm). Hope that gives you some idea on cost!,0

Note that there is a busy intersection you have to cross - there are walk signals, but they don't last too long if you are elderly or have mobility challenges.",1
6662,amayzingme,Oct 2019,We were driving most of the time because the attractions are not close to each other. The front of the resort is located on a main road so there was always traffic moving along at all times.,1
6662,Curtis Y,Oct 2019,very. They might still have construction in between but its safe most times of the day pretty nice place its gated and everyone is nice we had 14 people in 2 2 bedroom units on main floor.,1
6662,Gigglebox,Oct 2019,We had no issues walking at night. You walk by a lot of employee parking lots so there are people around most hours.,1
6662,Pradipta S,Oct 2019,Pretty safe. But just keep your eyes open after dark. There is a small bridge over an almost dry drain(?) just a few hundred feet from the hotel. It seems one or two people (homeless? rowdy?) live under that bridge. One day I saw one of them shouting and throwing bottles to someone. But honestly that type of thing can happen in any big US city. So no big issues.,1

If darker or later then you can walk along the Main Street from the strip to Koval Lane and these are well lit roads busy with traffic. Hope this helps. Enjoy your stay.",1

6666,catherinecP8915VK,Aug 2019,"While they do have a small convenience store on site, it has very limited choices, and prices are a bit high. So we mostly went over to Von's 1155 E Twain - about 5 minute drive away.",0
6666,Gary F,Aug 2019,I believe there is a Von's and an Albertson's a few blocks away to the southeast.,0
6666,Mike W,Aug 2019,Hi Folks - there is a shop on site downstairs behind reception - the Marketplace - which stocks all essentials but at a price. The Cafe does all beers &n some wines and spirits and does takeaway meals to eat in your apartment. However - we fly in from England - check in and go down to the large VONS for an excellent selection and with a Vons Card a good discount also on promo items. Another tip for a good meal and a beer is to walk the 300 yds to the LINQ - big wheel - and at the bottom is a Yard House with great food and lots of beers from everywhere. Have a great stay,0

They run about ever 30 minutes. you can check with the resort for more info. They are wonderful to work with.",1
6671,Jessica G,Jul 2019,The shuttle has certain stops next to other resorts. Runs in somewhat of a loop. We only used it once to get to the southern end of the strip by the fountains. Pick up is in the same places. I think last pickup is around 11? You have to be there early and you need to sign up ahead. We walked most of the time because resort is so close to the strip.,1

The construction area is well cordoned off with signage to walk around it. We usually walked off on foot daily unless we wanted to get to other sections of the strip.

I would recommend a ground floor unit, as there are no elevators, no worries about the kids running around and closer of course to the pool.",1
6692,DoverDaddy,Feb 2019,Found it safe and secure. You should have no worries about safety with this location. Just enjoy..,1
6692,fahim2015,Feb 2019,"Hi, i found it very secure during my visits me and my family often returned very late sometime even waliking back from the strip so with my experience of staying there i dont think you should be worrying about that, overall wherever you are travelling you have to be watchful, hope you have great time during your stay",1
6692,MD E,Feb 2019,"Regarding safety there's seedy characters everywhere in Vegas, do not be alone and guard your passport, a popular item that's stolen. For the Holiday Inn resort there is a guard at the gate, checking i.d. but be careful & alert always. Safe Travels.",1
6692,amy29amy,Feb 2019,"We walked to the strip both daytime and night and never felt unsafe. The resort has a gatehouse with an attendant checking people entering so I think it‚Äôs probably safe. There is a free shuttle to several points, schedule is limited and you need to let them know ahead. We never used it but others took advantage.",1
6692,H S,Feb 2019,"fantastic thanks so much, really reassuring, can't wait now. am sure the bonus of the pools being opened late will be great since we have kids with us. have emailed the hotel asking for ground floor villa in hope of opening out to the pool area any room tips welcome, or floor level for that matter?",0
6692,H S,Feb 2019,Aw thanks that‚Äôs reassuring. I would think we will use the shuttle as July and roasting. Anything we should Know x,0
6693,HIClubCounselor,Dec 2018,"Hi Michael! It is unlikely that our owners will elect to include the costs of adding Keurig machines or foot massagers to their annual shared expenses. Although we do not have Keurig‚Äôs in our villas, our Signature Collection villas do offer Espresso machines for our guests to use. Additionally, our Goldmine Bar & Grill offers cook-to-order food and beverage options, and our Marketplace offers freshly brewed coffee, espresso, cappuccino, hot chocolate, and other beverage options for purchase. The Winnick Street closure that began in November is expected to continue for several months. ‚ÄúCaesar‚Äôs Forum‚Äù is scheduled to open in late 2019. As more information becomes available, we will inform our owners and guests, and update our website. We hope to see you again soon!",0

6695,Lbpark,Nov 2018,Yes there is a safe,0
6695,NWbeswick3,Nov 2018,They also have a gate with security guards that everyone has to check in with and they have guards on bikes riding around. Hope this helps. Have a great time!,0

And your standing on the Stip. unless you can‚Äôt walk 10 minutes and I mean if your very slow. After the first shuttle ride we walked. We beat the shuttle across the street. It got stuck in traffic. The shuttle also gets to places along the strip.",0
6697,Rob C,Oct 2018,"Unless you have a specific place on the strip you want to go that is further away than you're comfortable walking, I would just walk to the LINQ promenade. This is full of bars and Restaurants and really cool place on your way to the strip. Plus you'll get there much faster than the shuttle. I did take the shuttle to Fremont(not walkable) but the last pickup was earlier than I wanted to go home. Just UBER home. This was a way to at least save money one way.",0
6697,Diane F,Oct 2018,The shuttle was great! Always on time and very friendly also. They are open to being asked thousands of questions üòÄ because we did! Enjoy your trip!,0
6697,Bird20,Oct 2018,"I didn't actually use the shuttle, but it does stop at 3 different destinations and sounded quite convenient. All that being said, its not very far to also walk, less than 15 mins form the giant Ferris Wheel by the Linq. In fact the HIVG resort is pretty much straight across from the Ferris wheel.",0
6697,thefamvaca,Oct 2018,This place is within walking distance of the strip. The shuttle runs until 11pm if memory serves me. You typically need to reserve your spot on the shuttle.,0
6697,ron S,Oct 2018,"The shuttle goes to Tropicana, Balls and the Linq. Evenings the have one that goes downtown and Stratosphere. These are rotating schedules. Not sure how late but your an easy walk to the Linq down a road by a parking lot. I've stayed here twice and had a great experience",0
6697,Mark L,Oct 2018,"We walk to the strip, maybe .5 mile at most if the FitBit is accurate, easy to walk straight up to the High Roller Wheel to strip. We have walked early am to late pm and never a problem. Shuttle runs on a good tight schedule, and very convenient. Need to reserve slots on shuttle for the downtown Fremont runs. Also, with Lyft now operating, an easy way to call and get a ride cheaper than a cab.",0
6697,pwrwmn,Oct 2018,"We used it just a couple of times to get to the Linc. We needed to be on the strip early. Uber was a better bet for us when we needed rides Downtown or to and from Caesar's. We also walked, alot! Got 10,000+ steps in a day back and forth from the convention center at Caesar's.",0
6697,elscoot57,Oct 2018,"We used the shuttle quite a bit. Destinations included Bally‚Äôs, the Linq (really right under the High Roller, an easy walk) and I think Flamingo. Drivers were all quite friendly. One return trip had more people than seats and not everyone got on. Our trip was in July 2018. Get to the lobby five or ten minutes early and you should be fine...check in at the station just outside.",0
6697,CJTolle99,Oct 2018,We didn't use the shuttle while we were there but If I remember correctly the shuttle has 3 or 4 stops it goes to on the strip and it hits each stop about once every hour. Next time I go I will stay on the strip.,0

6698,Eleanor M,Oct 2018,Yes they do supply all the cleaning items you‚Äôll need. I don‚Äôt recommend renting a car. Parking is a nightmare. Uber and Lyft are the ways to go. I also recommend Albertsons for less expensive breakfast/snacks drinks etc. Be aware they are pretty strict about check in times.,1
6698,Chaka D,Oct 2018,"They do provide you with cleaning supplies! Im not sure if they charge you once you run out. I did call them to bring me some fresh towels and I was told that they do charge for clean towels because each unit has a washer and dryer. But they let me exchange that one time for free. Everything is already in each unit...utensils, pots, pan, plates etc etc. It felt like I was at home. If your renting a car thats a plus cause you can drive to walmart or the 99 cent store to get food or supplies. The resort has a small store but it was very expensive.",1
6698,LT_Dallas,Oct 2018,"Hi You should have all you need, ready to go. The BBQ is first come first serve and free. I think your supplies are in your kitchen or available from front desk. They have s small marketplace onsight for anything that you need to purchase.",1

Because of their excellent rewards program, we book our rooms through BW reservation system. We did pay our first night room rate (stayed 4 nights) but it was refundable if for any reason we had to cancel. BW does book rooms at a lower rate that are not refundable, but you pay the total bill at time of booking.",0
6738,Margaret M,Nov 2018,Hello there yes there are shuttles to take you door to door and back to the airport. You will find them at ground transport. A round trip cost us $20 each and we had no problems. Enjoy!!,1
6738,JMJ,Jul 2019,There is no shuttle bus. Taxi or Uber are approx. $20,0
6738,Charles H,Jan 2019,Yes. Drop off at the back of the casino. We use Bell trans. I think round trip was $16.,0
6738,Simon W,Jan 2019,I know you might have travelled by now but save yourself the grief the buses are good but can get very crowded and you will be worried about getting off at the right spot as the hotel is just behind the casino. Just share a taxi. The buses being busy will let you on with luggage but other passengers will look at you as if you have brought an alligator on board. Not worth the risk and grief get a taxi.,0
6738,Trail793039,Nov 2018,Sorry I do not know. Had a hire car. You could e-mail them and ask. However I have stayed several time here and never seen one.,0
6738,Inyoung Lee,Nov 2018,"We used Lyft from the airport. Most of Lyft/Uber drivers had a hard time finding the main entrance of the hotel, so most of the time we used the drop off spot at Hurrahs hotel which is right next to our hotel. They have a drop off zone forUber/Lyft riders.",0
6738,Charles H,Nov 2018,We have used airport shuttles fore years with good results. Drop off at the door. Your way will work but kind of a hassle. Buss and mono rail might cost about the same as Bell-Trans. You can look it up. We started using Lyft this trip and love it. Here now and love it. Have fun on your trip.,0
6738,DesertCruiser062,Nov 2018,"My choice is to take the Westcliff Airport Express (WAX) bus from the airport to the Koval Lane stop on Tropicana Avenue -- for just $2. The Koval stop is one block east of the MGM Grand. Then I walk towards the MGM Grand, and board the Las Vegas Monorail, taking it north to the Harrah's Station. Walk northwest through Harrah's. The BW Casino Royale is immediately north of Harrah's. This is easy and cheap with minimal walking. To return to the airport, I take the monorail to the MGM Grand Station (the southernmost station at the moment), walk south across Tropicana Avenue to the bus stop on the south side of Tropicana Avenue. The WAX bus that arrives at this bus stop goes directly to the airport -- again, for just $2. Check the bus schedules closely as the WAX bus schedule is often 50 to 60 minutes apart.",0
6738,Guide63229910897,Nov 2018,We used Uber from airport and Lyft to airport. Both have promo codes so it should be much cheaper than a taxi. Airport pickup was easy - Google for directions. Drop off was right at hotel. Easy peasy! I am never going back to a taxi. Ps. This was my first Uber/Lyft rides ever,0
6738,2nurses2,Nov 2018,"The Lyft drop off is at the casino doors. Just put the app on your phone. Cheaper than a taxi. The Lyft pick up and drop off areas change so find out where the Lyft pick up spot is, get there, then use the app. It will tell you the type and color of the vehicle picking you up, the driver‚Äùs name and a picture, license plate number, plus puts you in direct communication with the driver..",0
6738,Tone365,Nov 2018,No shuttle bus....Taxis are plentiful and very little waiting time at the airport for one,0
6738,amd1958,Nov 2018,"We drove there from LA, so didnt use the airport. That said, I dont think they offer a shuttle bus. Taxi's are plentiful and can be pre-booked. Or, I think you can get the 108 bus from the Airport to the Flamingo Hotel and then the Deuce bus to Hurrahs hotel. The Best Western is next door",0
6738,Simon W,Nov 2018,There will be a bus but with luggage and if you are able to share costs get a taxi,0
6738,ericD6111JL,Nov 2018,Not offered by this hotel. Unless they just added it in the past month. They do have free parking thou if u rent a car.,0
6739,Joanne A,Oct 2018,Yes,1
6740,Charles H,Aug 2018,We've never tried a double twin. No twins that I know of. Double queen consists of 2 queen sized beds and the other amenities.,0
6741,kevin97wd,Aug 2018,no its ok we had no problems with the pool,0
6742,Mizmoe,Aug 2018,"We stayed at BW Casino Royal with our 7 year old grandson in July, 2018. It was wonderful! Hotel is located right in the middle of the strip. Ben & Jerry‚Äôs, In & Out Burgers, Subway, Pizza Hut and Denny‚Äôs are all located next to or inside the hotel. These are all favorites of my grandson and we went to them often. Our room faced the pool. Pool was a lot smaller than more famous hotels on the strip but it was perfect for us. Was never crowded, plenty of lounge chairs and towels and hotel staff blew up some beach balls and threw them into the pool for my grandson. He had a blast. Used the pool every day and sometimes twice a day. Rooms were clean and spacious. We covered the entire strip from Mandalay Bay to Circus Circus. We walked a lot but also took UBER‚Äôs which were very quick and reasonably priced. I am a BW Rewards member and was able to get the rooms for points which made our stay very affordable. My grandson loved Vegas and had a very fun time. It is a perfect place for kids to stay rather than the large themed hotels which would be overly crowded and easier for him to get lost. This hotel was extremely quiet because of its size and no noise at night from the strip, casino or other people. Slept very peacefully!! If ever in Vegas again, I would not hesitate to stay there again, with or without children!! Also, staff at this hotel are pleasant, helpful and very very accommodating. They went over and above to make sure we were happy.",3
6743,LoveTravel664500,Aug 2018,"AC worked beautifully! We were there during the end of July and they had record heat that week. Our AC kept it, dare I say.... COLD in our room! Lol Just how we like it.",1
6744,Stuart F,Aug 2018,More than helpful to keep ours at reception and given us access to pool during day with bottle water.,0
6744,Charles H,Aug 2018,They have always held our bags if our room isn't ready when we check in. Locked storage area.,0
6744,Bill C,Aug 2018,"Yes, the reception will take care of your bags till you depart.",0
6745,Guide63229910897,Nov 2018,Uber or Lyft is approx $15. Cheaper if you get a promo code,0
6746,HappyTraveller061958,Jul 2018,"We didn't have a car, there looked like some parking at the back not really secure. Check with the hotel they are very nice and I'm sure they will answer your question.",1
6746,Barb F,Jul 2018,We didn't have a car but I noticed there was some parking spaces available. I don't know if they are secure but I believe they were for hotel guests.,1
6746,Jeremy S,Jul 2018,"Public can park there ,but if I remember they can only stay there for two hours, if you are visitin the casino or staying at the hotel, they will give you a permit to use the parking lot for as long as you want to , if you don‚Äôt have the permit , they will tow your car",1
6746,Danny P,Jul 2018,"I saw a security guy walking around so in short, yes they do have security but not in the garage all of the time. I believe the garage has public parking. They will advise you to not leave any valuables in your car so I would be careful about parking there.",1
6746,Kenneth W,Jul 2018,"It's just a garage, but the better spots are saved for BW guests. It is right behind the hotel.",1
6746,Michael C,Jul 2018,They have there own spots in a small multi storey car park at the rear of the property you are given a ticket to display in your window. Security are present on the premises but I doubt that they do much patrolling of the car park. Public can also park in the car park but they are time restricted........allegedly.,0
6747,Bill C,Jun 2018,I think it is 8am till 10pm.,2

6748,d w,Apr 2018,About 15 minutes.,0
6748,tracy8623,Apr 2018,It‚Äôs about 10 -15 minutes walk or you can get the monorail,0
6748,Charles H,Apr 2018,!0 minutes is about right.,0
6748,hdg63,Apr 2018,Its about a km from the Hotel and should not take more than 10-12 minutes.,0
6748,Ydnar,Apr 2018,"It is very close, probably 10 minutes. That might not seem 'close', but of course it's Vegas and even staying right in a hotel (the MGM comes to mind), it might still take 10 minutes just to walk to the lobby. No real short-cuts but the Casino Royale is an ideal location if you're thinking Sands.",0
6749,Thomas M,Apr 2018,"Hello Kazza, thank you for choosing to stay with us while on holiday!! I would assume the other person commenting about risk would be because we do not have a lifeguard out at the pool. However, I promise you it is well maintained, clean, fresh and warm. I hope this helps you find the perfect bathing suit for your trip! We look forward to hosting you as our guest!",1
6750,CirrusPortland,Apr 2018,I'm not sure I even looked at it. Are you referring to the resort fee? They like most hotels will charge you for the first night when you book. I'm sure the website has all the charges and fine print.,0
6751,Amanda R,Mar 2018,for the low price you pay to be right on the main strip compared to every other hotel it's well worth it even without breakfast like all the other locations usually have there is a Danny's but there is also a walg reens close and a breakfast diner right down the strip towards downtown plus free parking..can t beat it,2
6752,Thomas M,Feb 2018,"I am not allowed to provide this via this website but, if you can call the hotel and ask for Thomas, I'll be happy to help!",1
6752,Jeannette S,Feb 2018,Perfect thank you Thomas,0
6753,Ydnar,Feb 2018,"You will want to enter the casino parking garage by NOT turning into the lot off the Strip (pedestrians never stop to let you by). I'd avoid trying to access anything by driving on the Strip...Access the parking off Koval behind the property, then follow through under the Harrah's parking sign, you'll see the Best Western parking past this on the right. You can get to the reception area through the casino from the back (don't worry, it's fast).",2
6753,Chris C,Feb 2018,"Yes, if you are driving North on the S Las Vegas Blvd you can drive into a little alleyway beside the casino and use the rear entrance to check in etc. It doesn't show on Google maps, but you can see it on Google Streetview. The entrace is between Walgreens and The Venetian.",1
6753,GregYeo,Feb 2018,There is a driveway on the right hand side of the casino. This leads to a car park and back entrance. Beers are half the price of anywhere else...üç∫,1
6753,MrPurser,Feb 2018,We used the driveway off the strip next to the Walgreen Store to get into the car park - then through the rear entrance to reception. Quite easy and the pedestrians were O.K.,0
6753,Mike,Feb 2018,yes i agree from rear,0
6753,Sandy M,Feb 2018,We used the strip entrance to get into the parking lot and the back entrance to leave as it was too confusing especially at night to enter the back way. Hope this helps,0
6753,Danny P,Feb 2018,"Like @ydnar said, the cross entrance off of the strip can be a hassle to get across. However, if you are not familiar with the streets it is the easiest to find. We didn't drive but took a Lyft (Uber won't pick up there) and our Lyft drivers didn't have a problem using the front entrance driveway.... you just have to have a bit of patience. It also depends on what time of day you are entering and leaving.",0

6754,Danny P,Feb 2018,"If you don't mind your kids walking in and out of a casino. It is not a resort hotel with things to do. The rooms are nice for a single person or a couple (or two) with a casino and a small food court. The hotel is clean and the staff is great, my wife and I love it, but we'd never go there with our kids. If you are looking for cheaper rooms with resort amenities, try Treasure Island, it's just across the street.",0

6754,Debby76,Jan 2018,I stayed there but don't have children. There is a small swimmingpool so if you want to swim a lot with the kids maybe you should take a larger hotel with a huge pool. But the rooms are perfect. Denny's right next to the hotel for breakfast and at the strip!,0
6755,AustinBluffs,Jan 2018,"I used a credit card at check in but all fees were included with my Expedia booking so nothing was charged. I am not sure if a cash deposit is acceptable. I called to ask about early check in before I traveled and the hotel staff was very friendly. I think their number is 1 (702) 737-3500. The following was stated on my reservation. Maybe this means you could make the deposit in cash? You'll be asked to pay the following charges at the property: Deposit: USD 30 per night We have included all charges provided to us by the property. However, charges can vary, for example, based on length of stay or the room you book. The price shown above DOES NOT include any applicable hotel service fees, charges for optional incidentals (such as minibar snacks or telephone calls), or regulatory surcharges. The hotel will assess these fees, charges, and surcharges upon check-out.",0

I have been a member for years and really like the program especially when I am on road trips. The second program is the casino rewards program. They will give you back the first 20 dollars you lose and 20 dollars back for every 100 dollars you lose after that. My wife lost 20 on slots. Using her card she got her $20 back. She continued playing and ended up winning $291 on the Buffalo Stampede machine. Needless to say, she was ecstatic.",0

You can buy the ticket on the strip at various points on the strip.,1
6763,Raghunath I,Oct 2017,"Depends on time of day and traffic conditions and the size of the taxi you take. 4 people with big (26"") luggage will need a larger car. A regular sedan sized car with space for 4 cabin bags (just about) will cost $20 (Uber/Lyft) typically. Can be even $15. But a larger vehicle (Lyft calls it 6 plus) will cost near about $35.",0

6773,Senlac1066,Feb 2017,Look at travellers photos here on Trip Advisor as this will give you a much better idea of what to expect.... especially for your wedding/honeymoon. Motel type rooms may be exactly what you are looking for but do your research on photos and compare to other places. Location is spot on for convenience but we purposefully booked to stay here only 1 night. Booked it as a budget hotel for somewhere to sleep as we had late arrival into Las Vegas and then spent rest of 10 days at 2 other hotels to experience different places. Pool area is small with limited shade and not very private... (next to the car park) and with summer temperatures reaching over 100 degrees you will be pleased to have a nice pool area to retreat to... this isn't that. Again check photos and whatever you decide wish you a very lovely time. Wishing you a lovely time,0

I mean I spent zero time in my room so why pay hundreds per night?it does not have alot of amenities but is in a very good local with Walgreens next door and 5 mins walking to all the major casinos. the staff was very friendly and helpful plus it has amazing free parking garage with a very good security team walking the garage and grounds constantly I felt very safe even at night going out to the car or around the grounds without my husband,1

6778,Thomas M,Jan 2017,"Hello Reg N! Shuttles do stop at our hotel. You can purchase your fare at the airport when you arrive at the airport. As mentioned by Ron, they do charge a per-person fee and stop at several hotels along the way, which could result in a lengthy trip in either direction. A taxi is approximately $20-$25 each way and is the same rate for up to 4 people at the same price. Alternatively, you could use a ride hailing service such as Uber or Lyft for your transport which could be even more cost effective. I hope this information helps you in planning your trip to our fabulous city! Please do not hesitate to contact us directly if we may be of further assistance. We look forward to hosting you as our guest!",0
6779,Thomas M,Jan 2017,"Hello Pollygirls! We are happy to say that we do not charge anything beyond room and tax for our guests :) we believe that what you pay for your room should include all necessary amenities at no ""extra"" charge. We also provide free WIFI, computer, print and fax services, all rooms have a mini-fridge and Keurig coffee maker and it's all included for free! I hope this helps you in deciding where to book your accommodations for FABULOUS LAS VEGAS!!",3
6780,Thomas M,Nov 2016,"Hello Golfer! Our guaranteed check-in time is 4:00PM however, we happily check guests in as early as 10:00AM at no extra charge providing we have a room ready. I hope this helps in planning your trip, we look forward to hosting you as our guest! If you know your flight will arrive in Vegas early, please notify us and we will do our best to have a room ready earlier for you.",0
6780,cibiem,Jan 2017,"My experience: if a room is ready, hotel will check you in. That is not a hotel with hundreds of rooms, where you almost certainly will get a room regardless at which time you check in. So that is understandable and should not keep you from booking there. Location is super convenient Mid Strip. Although very close to the action, I found the rooms to be quiet. And I've stayed there 3 times. I think the windows are very soundproof. One thing I especially like is the back entrance to garage. No need to drive the Strip to get to the garage.",0
6781,Thomas M,Nov 2016,"Hello Peta, Unfortunately, we do not have roll away beds available due to fire code. Our max occupancy is 2 people in a room with a king size bed or 4 people in a room with 2 double beds, but these numbers are based on use of existing bedding in the room only. I hope this helps in making your decision!",0

6782,Amanda R,Nov 2016,I saw several smaller children and lots of teenagers in the hotel just not allowed in the casino. the front desk is tricky to find from the parking area you have to walk through the casino to get to the desk so I would have your kid wait with you or the hubby...while one of you checks in,0
6782,Robert S,Nov 2016,Young persons were in the hotel so I am assuming that there is no reason for under 21's to be accommodated,0

6782,Rohit_D_Gurgaon,Nov 2016,Should not be a problem. Please call the hotel to doublecheck,0
6782,DanielNetherlands197,Nov 2016,"Theresa, I think this will be possible. As long as 1 person is 21 or up it would be no problem. A call to rhe hotel can be helpfull. Enjoy your stay!",0
6783,Angeline Travels,Apr 2016,A/C could get pretty cold for us so may be perfect for you. We would leave it on automatic when we left the room for a few hours or as we slept. We stayed at the end of March 2016 and the weather was an average of 20 deg celsius/60 deg fahrenheit or below.,1
6783,stella3625,Apr 2016,"No problem with the AC I've stayed at MGM Luxor Venetian Bellagio Flamingo and Caesar, This hotel is good for the price if you just want a place to sleep, staff helpful we had no problems and no resort fees. Hope this helps",1

6783,misspNewJersey,Apr 2016,My stay was last November when Las Vegas was in the grip of a cold snap. I would suggest that you contact the front desk prior to your stay. They were wonderfully helpful and would probably be able to make certain you had a room with a fully functioning AC system. Great reasonable place to stay if you are looking for a place to rest.,0

6783,Marc B,Apr 2016,"Hi. We had no issue with the air conditioning in our room and we like things super cool at night. We were there in August of last year and temps were well into the 100 degree range. Never been to the Tropicana nor the mirage but we much preferred it to the MGM, Luxor and Excalibur. I hate paying their resort tax, I hate that they don't supply coffee machine in room and the parking is so much easier. Have a great trip. We are off on a drive from Vernon, British Columbia to Montreal on Sunday for 2 weeks there to visit family and friends Marc",0
6783,David O,Apr 2016,AC was fine when we were there in January. Hard to say how it would cope in summer heat though .,0

6785,sargieboy,Oct 2015,No resort fees were charged to me on my recent stay. Entrance to hotel is a little hard to find but a good taxi cab driver should know the way. Location great and room was value for money.,0
6785,cibiem,Oct 2015,There were no resort fees in 2015. I recommend making reservation on bestwestern com. Reservation confirmations are very detailed and show all fees and taxes. See line: 'Other Taxes & Fees Breakdown (additional charges may apply):' in the confirmation. A resort fee - if any - should be stated in that line IMO. Best Western Casino Royale charges the first night of your stay to your credit card immediately as a deposit.,0

6786,MariAnne H,Sep 2015,"Hi, If you are driving the strip, you turn right after walgreens and drive behind the hotel. You can also access the parking from the back of the hotel (koval street) then you just pass harrah's parking and follow the road all the way to the end, parking is on your right. There is plenty of parking, at least 4 floors. I hope this helps üòä",3
6786,Andy P,Sep 2015,"Lots of answers already. Driving north its easy, as someone has already said, look foor the little ally just past the hotel (next to Wallgreens) Driving south is a little more difficult. You pass the hotel on you left, and there is soon a U-turn possibility at a set of traffic lights. Your then traveling north and can get to the ally. I never had parking problems. Althouth the spaces in the garage are relatively small. You can park near the back entrance to go to reception to get a slip of paper to show your leagally parked. Be careful, the basement floor of the garage is for staff only.",1
6786,MelHes,Sep 2015,"Walgreens is an American drug store or pharmacy. If you are driving north on the Vegas strip, go past the Flamingo casino. Then keep going a little ways until you see the casino royale on the right. You will see the Outback Steakhouse sign too. That's the best western hotel. Turn right just when you pass it. You will see a little alley. That is the parking area. If you see parking on the right for the Venetian hotel and casino, you've gone too far. Hope this helps! :)",1
6786,Joannebo,Sep 2015,"If you are travelling North on the strip, you pass the hotel then the car park is signposted just past Walgreens. It's helpful to look on google earth before travelling. It's a multi story so plenty of spaces but 1st you park in a waiting area while checking in and you are given a slip to display in your car Enjoy!!",1

6787,Trevor P,Sep 2015,We paid $30 one way mid afternoon mainly because traffic was so heavy & he went in a circular route. Then $21 back early morning when there was no traffic on the road. This was August 2015. So $20 - $30 is a good guideline. Between four of us it amounted to ¬£5 each one way and ¬£4 each back.,1
6788,Chris B,Sep 2015,I think the room had an iron & ironing board in the closet. Enjoy your stay in Las Vegas :),0
6789,traumaERrn,Aug 2015,There are photos on their web site of the rooms. I have only stayed in a standard room But I like the location,0
6790,Norman H,Jul 2015,No views but the Casino location and price more than compensates for that. Our room on the 3rd. floor was comfortable and we had a small bar frig and coffee maker.,1
6790,cibiem,Jul 2015,"Sorry for late answer, I had to go find my records. We stayed in 421 and had a glimpse view of the Mirage and the Venetian. And a view of the pool (yes, there is a pool, small, but good enough to cool off.) I had rooms with a view of the Strip at the Mirage, Bellagio and TI. We stayed at the former Imperial Palace later Quad (now LinQ) and we had views of the Flamingo when we steppd out on the balcony. The balconies are gone, and since the room rates are no longer reasonable, I quit booking at the LinQ. There are hotels wih buildings set back from the Strip, so a view of the Strip can only be in a distance. After 2 decades of visiting LV and the rooms becoming more and more expensive, my priorities changed. I honestly think you get the best Strip view ON THE STRIP. And a hotel room is now mainly to get a good nights sleep, a clean and comfortable place to stay. That's what I've found at the Best Western Casino Royale. Hope this helps. Good luck with your search.",0
6790,coppertone_dreads,Jul 2015,Because this hotel is smaller and surrounded by the larger hotels a decent view of the strip you won't get. The only thing we seen from our room (and we were on the top floor) was the parking structure of Harrah's.,0
6790,BossErpe-Belgium,Jul 2015,The rooms are at the back. There is no view on the strip. I think all rooms are OK.,0
6790,GMLSYDNEY,Jul 2015,"We stayed on the 3rd floor no views on the strip,better as nice and quiet, good access for guests from car park or strip clean, good service but no fridge Overall would stay again, nice and central without the outlandish price!",0
6790,Roger S,Jul 2015,Hi just ask for an odd numbered room on a high floor and you will get glimpes of Mirage and the Venetian. Despite what another answer said there is a pool. There are also nice views from Dennys and the Outback steakhouse. You will find Casino Royale a great place to stay if you want convenience but don't want the big hotel experience.,0
6790,CharlesS916,Jul 2015,"There is a pool, because I could see it out my window, but I wouldn't call it a ""view"".",0
6790,Turkishholidaylover,Jul 2015,"Any room is the same I think, as others have said. You may get some noise from the parking lot if you have an odd numbered room, ask for a higher even number to be further back from the Strip and away from the car park. Also, ask for a first floor room to avoid the elevators.",0
6790,janeds,Jul 2015,The hotel is built behind the casino so there aren't any views- just side views of the Venetian and if you are at the left side of the coridoor you may get a pool view as we did but it really doesn't matter - you are getting a really clean modern room in a fab position on the Strip for an incredibly cheap price - enjoy!,0
6790,Marty Bielicki,Jul 2015,"No rooms have a view. And, no pool either. What you are getting is the best price on the strip for a clean comfortable room. The Mirage is across the street and the Venitian is a short walk away.",0
6790,JEN F,Jul 2015,There are no rooms with views because the hotel is in between others and not tall enough for Vegas views.,0
6790,christine t,Jul 2015,"I stayed at the Best Western Casino Royale in May and there are no rooms with views, certainly not of the Strip. I had room 225 and that had a sideways view of part of the Venetian - not wonderful but a view of sorts. The room I think was much like the rest, absolutely fine and had a coffee maker and 'fridge.",0
6791,coppertone_dreads,Jul 2015,Your best bet would be to contact the hotel directly. You don't want any surprises.,0
6793,Cincytraveler621,May 2015,"OK... I talked about the AC when I reviewed the property. We were there in December. The room was hot when we came in and we wanted to cool it down. When we called the front desk, they said that they could not control the temp that ""it is set."" Since it wasn't that hot, we decided to open the windows. The problem with that solution was that our room was at the front of the hotel so it was really noisy. This is a great hotel... so convenient, no resort fees, free wi-fi. I wouldn't change my reservations. I like a cooler room too... but honestly, the room will feel quite cool after coming in from 110 degrees outside. Good luck!",2

Did resort to opening the windows, which was OK but as mentioned a bit noisy. However, coming from England we don't have air-con very much here (we just have horrible weather) so could be I'm just not good as using these systems. Not a reason to stay elsewhere though.",1

6793,Norman H,May 2015,Hi we stayed in April and the weather not that hot and coming from Queensland Aust. it was similar to our temps. The AC in our room worked o.k and had it set at 23c.,1

6795,Thomas M,Apr 2015,Hello Misslaydj! You will not have any issues with having plenty of cold air in your room when you stay in July! The issue these guests refer to was remedied by installing new thermostats with better sensors. We have not had any issues since. We are looking forward to having you as our polar bear cool guest!,1
6795,KathyGran,May 2015,You will not have a problem with the AC the hotel is very clean location is great,1
6795,misslaydj,Apr 2015,Awesome!!!! Thank you so so much!!! :-) I'm a happy camper now. Esp with that type of heat in Vegas. To confirm its still central air though? I just hope its not 80 degrees in the room,0
6796,Cecilia C,Apr 2015,"As a guest, I m not sure what they did, but I think they don t charge anything before checking out, they just keep your credit card as hold without charges",0
6797,janeds,Apr 2015,We gave a debit card as a hold but paid with a cash passport card and it has taken almost three weeks for the hold to be lifted from the card so if you don't intend to settle up with debit card I suggest you use a credit card for hold.,0
6797,javierr2003,Apr 2015,Yes you can use a debit card. I use all time in VEGAS. But don't go to BALLYS. they look down on. So I pulled AMX black n they kissed my but. But Best Western no problem. Great Hotel. Ask for room facing Veneation Hotel. Best. Have fun.,0
6797,SherryAmes,Apr 2015,I booked through an on line website using a credit card. One night of our four night stay was immediately charged to the card at time of booking. You should check with the hotel directly about using a debit card.,0

However, as the deals inside change monthly, it would be hard to guarantee that it would include Mystere. As mentioned by some of my favorite past guests, we do have a TIX4TNT booth on-site with daily 2-for-1 show specials. That is not the end of it though, our team (or myself) will be happy to assist in web searches for discount coupons if you would like as well! I can't wait for you to be relaxing on Holiday with us!",0
6799,Cincytraveler621,Mar 2015,"There is a ticket booth right outside the hotel called Tix4Tonight. There is a line when it opens in the morning so it's best to line up as early as you can because the process can be slow. The employees walk around with an Ipad to let you know what tickets are available and at what price but you still have to line up to get them! I suggest that you know what you want, get in line and wait for the employees with Ipad to come to you. There is a VIP line for guests on their second visit on consecutive days.",0
6799,CoupleOfNuts2,Mar 2015,"I think we got a coupon book at check-in that had discounts (2 for 1) to most shows. I don't specifically remember Cirque du Soleil, but as another traveler mentioned, there is a place nearby where you can get tickets.",0

6800,Thomas M,Mar 2015,"Hello again HueiWuan! The other travellers advice is exactly what I would say, the Deuce (our city bus) is going to be your least expensive option and it is a clean, airconditioned, comfortable ride! If you'd rather a faster, more private transport, a taxi would be best but will cost significantly more than the bus. Now, start dreaming of fun and relaxation, we'll see you soon!",0
6801,Hoteladvisor88,Mar 2015,No they don't but you can book in advance with the bell shuttle and it will drop you off at hotel and pick you up for the return trip and is very affordable. It stops at several hotels along the way so you kinda get a nice quick tour,0

The hotel has little or nothing in the way of views, but is pleasantly quiet, especially if you get a room towards the rear of the building away from its casino and the Strip. The hotel's trump card is its small size and easy access to the Strip.",1

6810,paul b,Jan 2015,"Hi I had a room viewing the pool, slightly noisy so I would take a shot at the venetian side for sure, don't think the have rooms viewing the strip but worth asking the question. Hope this helps, Paul",1
6810,SunshineDaydream73,Jan 2015,There are pros and cons to each side of the hotel. The rooms facing the strip get the only view. However this view is more of the Mirage and the volcano that goes off LOUDLY every half hour in the evenings and also shakes the mirrors. Strip noise is also pretty bad when the windows are open because you are only a few stories up. Windows do a fairly good job of blocking sound. Back side rooms have a view of the alley which was ugly and barren but more private and quiet. No room windows on the other side of the alley so no peepers accross the way. Hope this helps and enjoy Vegas!,1
6810,martincath,Jan 2015,"Yes - none of the rooms face the Strip, but the higher floors further back on the north side face the Venetian. Downside is if you can see it, you can also HEAR it (there's a clock tower that might wake you on the hour through the night...)",1

We also picked this since we have kids and wanted to be away from the strip but in retrospect the convenience of being close to the casinos and taking a break when tired is lost.

Planet Hollywood is kinda in the middle of them. Also, be aware that the hotel shuttle has a schedule- be sure to pick up the shuttle times at the front desk. It's a courtesy shuttle, but not available to you whenever you might want it (except for airport pickup and drop offs). Have fun!",0

6838,CABSBAGS,Oct 2016,"Congratulations on the upcoming birthday celebration! You are going to LOVE the MGM! True glamour. Has to be one of my favorite Vegas Resort Hotels! First; make sure to register for your free membership with MLife if you have not already done so. Take advantage of all the Perks available to you during your stay, i.e. restaurants, shops, Shows, Hotels, etc... I enjoyed the fact that the VIP Concierge made my reservations for me and my amazing son to see Michael Jackson's ONE, show at Mandalay Bay. You will be able to go to most any Show of your choosing at any one of the MGM Resort properties. Spectacular. Try to check in as early as possible to make the most of your stay. Even if your room is not ready yet, check your bags at the bell stand and go hang out at the restaurant pool side, sip something cool under an umbrella and enjoy! Next, your Hotel is right across the street from NYNY, another great MGM Resort property. You should also go tour Steve Wynn's properties: 1. Bellagio (the Conservatory, and of course the Fountains). 2. Encore; make sure to go to this one BEFORE Wynn, as the hotels are connected underground and you walk right into the Wynn. Stunning). Stop by Sinatra's for a drink and dessert. 3. Wynn (Hotel Lobby, amazing floral displays! Go to the Lagoon, right off of the Lobby. Go to the second floor outdoor patio bar and sip your favorite drink and enjoy the awesomeness of the Lagoon.) Finally, the Wynn has the cutest mini Fountains (smaller version of the Bellagio Fountains.) Adorable! Next, make sure to go to Caesars Palace Forum Shops. THE Best shopping mall on the planet! Great people watching and check out the cool free show in front of Nike and the Cheesecake Factory. Fun! Finally; for transportation, I utilize the following: Uber, for distance, including to and from the airport; the Tram from the Mandalay Bay to Excalibur; the Tram from Mirage to Treasure Island (this hotel is across the street from the Venetian, a Must see! When at the Venetian, go to second level which is above the Casino and enjoy the Gondolas! Then go to the City Square and sit in one of the benches in front of the Living Statutes. Breathtaking. Read my reviews including of the MGM in my TripAdvisor name: YarnDenver Enjoy. CAB",-2

6840,melb1938,Jun 2018,No it is not true. They do not separate guests with Pets from those who do not have pets. That was our case. We had people with pets next door. Barking dogs at all hours especially in the mornings.,0

6840,Deanna B,Nov 2017,That did not seem the case. I believe I requested a room on the bottom floor because of the ease of taking our dog in and out when needed. There were pets on the third floor. I don't feel pet owners were separated from the other guests. Hope this helps...,0
6840,Trigor,Oct 2017,"We stayed at 4 different La Quintas while working our way home from Arizona to Washington State.

But the hotel itself is in a small cul-de-sac with a mixed area of offices with the hotel and is quite pleasant. I personally didn't see anything that would concern me, although closer to the highway turn-off in the daytime I did see pan-handlers with the usually cardboard signs.

6912,Bryan M,Apr 2018,I have reviewed the previous posts and find them accurate. I would like to add a feature that we like best about this location--the access to transportation to other areas. The monorail is right outside the property. Harrah's garage (where many free shuttles are stationed) is just a short walk. The Orleans shuttle (one of our favorite properties) is right out the back door to the street and the Deuce station is just a short walk. All these are available if you happen to tire of all the activities and eateries that are in this area! We have been visiting Vegas several times each year for about 20 years and we will probably continue to do so for many to come. We have stayed at many properties and this one remains one of our favorites.,0
6912,Tim Q,Apr 2018,"The walk to the strip from the Flamingo HGVC property is approximately the same as the walk from the Elara. You can skirt the Flamingo Casino on the left and walk on limited access roadway for the Flamingo and the Cromwell Hotel. You can also walk through the Flamingo directly to the Strip or you can walk to the right of the Flamingo past the pool and through the Flamingo to the Linq and then access the Strip We were in a two bedroom unit (which is a combination of an efficiency unit and a one bedroom unit). The furniture while not new, is well maintained. Hilton will approach you to partake in a sales pitch for the timeshare, but unless you are accessing the property via a lowered price marketing tool and have already committed to the sales pitch, you can ignore the approach. The staff is the best feature of the property and the location and condition of the Hilton is excellent. The sole difficulty we have experienced in the 20 years we have been going to the property is the parking garage. The first three floors are reserved to valet parking for both the Flamingo Casino/Hotel and the Flamingo HGVC. The parking garage is located to the left of the HGVC (looking toward the Strip) and is a tad convoluted to walk between the HGVC and the parking garage.",0

6912,Steve B,Apr 2018,The property adjoins The Flamingo and the Linq promenade. If you want your room to look out on The Strip this isn't it - but you can't get any closer. We had a one bedroom suite and the furniture was comfortable. Staff were welcoming but not intrusive.,0

6933,705phillygirl,May 2017,"No there is no free access to the Flamingo's pool, but you can pay a fee to swim there. But there is a smaller pool adjacent to HGV that is free.",0
6933,Kandyceelise,May 2017,"Yes, the over 21 one.",0
6933,Bryan M,May 2017,Yes. However we prefer the HGVC pool because it is quieter and more to our liking.,0
6933,corinneEngland,May 2017,Yes you do. Just take your room key. Not sure if you can jump the line or not though cos I much prefer the pool at Hilton.,0
6934,HiltonGrandVacations,May 2017,"There is a pathway that leads to the Flamingo entrance through the gardens area. You are correct, there are a lot of panhandlers along the strip.",3
6935,HiltonGrandVacations,May 2017,"Thank you all for your feedback. If you need any additional information, please reach out to us.",0
6935,Bryan M,May 2017,"From 10 - 5 you can hear mostly bass in the room. The music is not loud enough to be identified, but it is ever present. Also, we were on an upper floor.",2
6935,Scott H,May 2017,"We had a room on the 5th floor, south tower, and never heard the music.",1
6935,Scott H,May 2017,We had a room facing the pool and never heard the music.,1
6935,Linda E,May 2017,"The sound is more of a bom bom in the background, nothing that disturbs how you function in the room. It is rather loud when you go outside and can hear it from ""our"" pool. It's not enough that you can't sleep through it but it also doesn't start until between 9 and 10 in the morning and ""turns"" off around 6 or so.",1
6935,Me925,May 2017,"Sorry, but I spent the afternoons at the pool, so I am unsure if it was loud in the suite. I had no concerns in the mornings or evenings.",1
6935,Steve A,May 2017,"It was loud enough that it could be heard in the room. It wasn't window shaking loud but enough it was distracting. If someone wanted to rest in the afternoon, it would be very difficult. That with the fact the pool party next door ran 10am-5pm. It was going when I left the room in the morning and when I returned to get ready for dinner. My issue is Hilton's description of a quite place. During the pool party it definitely isn't quite. If you want to enjoy the Hilton pool you will most certainly have entertainment. I think as long as your aware of it you would be fine.",1
6935,Ernie B,May 2017,The music is loud! Go Pool is a big space and they fill the area with partying millenials consuming a lot of beer. The Hilton pool is right next to Go Pool so you will be in the midst of the music. Quiet time comes when the pool shuts down.,1
6935,EastCoastTravels,May 2017,We stayed there in mid March (before spring break). Our room was on the second floor right adjacent to the Flamingo pool and honestly it didn't bother us. We weren't in the room much and I remember thinking I might be concerned when we first arrived but it wasn't that loud. You can hear it when you're at the hilton pool or walking the grounds but again I didn't find it intrusive.,1
6935,ssk,May 2017,"I was only occasionally in my room during pool hours and I don't recall hearing the music that loudly from my room (I had a pool view). But you will most definitely hear the music when you're at the HGVC pool. Over the weekend, I didn't like the music (I'm a middle aged gal) so I put my earbuds on. By Monday, their music was a little more mainstream and not nearly as loud. Fortunately, the Flamingo pool closes around six so it never bothered me in our suite.",1
6935,Robin E,May 2017,Very loud techno music. Very loud bass. You can hear it All day in the rooms. Don't get a migraine there! They all face the pool which faces flamingos pool,1
6935,Kris D,Nov 2017,"Yes. If you stay between April and October, there will be a chance that there will be a live DJ at the Flamingo Go Pool from 10-6. It is obvious in the rooms, especially the bass;however, I could hear everything as I am ""younger."" I do not mind the music; however, I sleep during the day, so that was a day without sleep for me. :-) This is not the fault of HGVC as when the property was built at least 20 years ago the Flamingo was also owned by Hilton and that is why the location was chosen. Now, Caesar's Entertainment owns the property and their goal is to use the Flamingo Go pool as a millennial attractant. Think of all of the other shifts that have occurred along the Strip over the last 15 years or so, with an emphasis on expensive food and other activities.",0
6935,InadvertentGypsy,May 2017,We never heard the music but I would think in some rooms you might hear a faint idea of it. But the rooms are so lovely I imagine you'd quickly forget!,0
6935,Patti C,May 2017,Probably not!,0
6935,Tania S,May 2017,"Hi James I was there is January and the pool wasn't being used, so not able to comment on that, sorry.",0

This entitles you to park on the fourth floor of the Flamingo Hotel parking structure. *Tip* Like everything in Vegas, self-parking can be a distance from the hotel. Think 10-15 minute walk, if you don't get lost. Best practice is to unpack your car and leave your bags with the bellman or in your room BEFORE moving your car. *Yes, there are irons and ironing boards.",2

They have small family pool area.",1
6941,KeenieBeans,Mar 2017,"To add to the info above. ************************** The Flamingo also has a *pool slide* into its own separate pool that the kids just adore. It's off to the west side of the pool area. Get there at open to snag a chair line of eye sight to the kids at the slide. Its very fun and a reason why some people stay at the Flamingo/HGVC. The Flamingo pools generally close at about 5 or 6pm. The HGVC pool area stays open longer. You can also grill poolside. The pool bar might be open or you could use the pool phone to call for food delivery from the deli/mini-mart. **** Outer door... The outer door are is very safe, but you might have to pull the door shut, sometimes it stays ajar. You can also bring or ask for a door stop to keep the inside doors open. There is a supplementary door lock latch on the inside doors. I normally push this out and it blocks the door from closing shut. In this way, we keep the access to both rooms open. *** My kids (7 and 13) love staying at the HGVC Flamingo.",1
6941,Krissy K,Mar 2017,"I did not have the 2 bedroom suite (we just had 1 bedroom). I understand all the units have a washer dryer right inside the room, ours did, and it was soooo helpful. You do have access to all the Flamingo pools, as well as the pool at this particular hotel (duh!). You will love this hotel. It does not have all the hub-bub as many other hotels on the strip (meaning, easy check-in, no casino gaming). The pool area is loud in the summer, so be sure to get a room that's higher up to help with the noise levels. Loud music is what I'm referring to, and lots of people. Oh well, it's Vegas! You should definitely stay here. They also have a mini-market for essentials. Expensive, but it beats getting into Vegas traffic to find a grocery store. Loved the full kitchen in our room, complete with utensils, dishes, glasses, and a dishwasher!",1
6941,debindenton,Mar 2017,"Yes, the double doors can be locked with a deadbolt. It's like a small entryway with your room doors to the left and right.

6962,ntmomPa_,Apr 2016,"Both Harrah's and the Mirage are close. I would guess it's a 5 to 10 minute walk. Easy walk. We walked all the way to the MGM for our ""Ka"" show and that was about a 25 minute walk. By the way, I used Uber and Lyft for the first time when I was in Las Vegas and it was great. I never had to wait more than 2 to 3 minutes for a ride. All the drivers were great and friendly and I will never use a cab again. The only time I used a cab was from the airport to the Hilton and it cost about $20. On my way home, I used Lyft from the Hilton to the airport and it was about half the price. I used Lyft more because for signing up with them, they gave me a discount on my first 4 rides; Uber only gave me a discount on my first ride. Altogether, I used Lyft/Uber about seven times in Las Vegas. Many of the drivers are wx-taxi and ex-limousine drivers and some are just regular people. I even had a retired gentleman in a Lexus pick me up.",0

6965,HiltonGrandVacations,Feb 2016,Thank you all for your feedback.,1
6965,Ricki21,Mar 2016,"The monorail is heavily used especially by convention go-ers to and from the LV Convention center. The rides are quick and I have been on them safely during the day and up to midnight but can't answer for later than that. The drawback to the monorail is that at some stops such as Paris Paris, the walk (inside the casino) from the stop to the casino center is at least 10 min or more so be prepared to do some walking to and from the stops.",1
6965,yogrant,Feb 2016,"It appeared safe. When I used the monorail there was an attendant/security at each station. The stations were well lit, also being elevated, you can't just walk on from the street like a bus. I can't guarantee that its the same today, but I think it should be.",1
6965,flipper13357771,Feb 2016,We have traveled the monorail for several years and found it to be safe and clean.,1
6965,Allan R,Feb 2016,"I've never had any problems traveling on the monorail at any time.I've attended several conferences there over the years and it's always been safe and convenient. There is an airport shuttle from the airport to the Flamingo but not directly to the HGVF, but you can just walk around the corner where the bus drops you off. and I believe the Mandalay Bay is only one stop from the one at the Flamingo.",1
6965,arubanow,Feb 2016,Traveled on monorail a lot while in Vegas. Was every surprised as coming from Boston. Thought it would be like our subway. Very wrong. It was very clean and safe. Traveled at day time and night. Airconditioned also. Would recommend to everyone. Saves a lot of walking in heat.,1
6965,tam2gab,Feb 2016,The monorail is very safe. They do have security officers patrolling the cars and the stations. We use the monorail to avoid the crush of people on the strip. And if you buy a multi day pass it is not very expensive.,1
6965,ArubaCanada,Feb 2016,Yes we did use the monorail and the bus. It was always full of ppl and safe even at 4am. There are police that are walking on the street and hop on and off the buses. It was not a problem at all in terms of safety.,1
6966,HiltonGrandVacations,Feb 2016,We do not offer any transportation.,1
6966,Micah214,Feb 2016,"No, but round trip transportation from the airport is about $16 per person using Showtime tours. There's a window outside of baggage claim. I didn't see a shuttle bus while we were there but there is a taxi stand at the Flamingo hotel and Uber is available too for other transportation. There is a monorail station close and the Deuce bus picks up in front of the Flamingo also; both affordable.",2
6966,Ricki21,Feb 2016,"This is a timeshare so they do not offer airport rides. Taxi's are available and the airport is only 10-15 min away so not too expensive To get to Mandalay Bay you can take the LV Tram (daily ticket, 24 hr ticket, weekly tickets), take it to the end of the line, and walk the remainder of the way",1

6974,laurie h,Jun 2020,I was there in the last week pool was not open. Rate was $150/ night including fees,1
6974,Smitty09876,Jun 2020,"My most recent info comes from a trip the last week in February 2020. Yes ,there is a resort fee of about 30 to 40 US$ so one of your estimates is correct. However, I‚Äôd suggest you call the hotel and ask about a few things: .....what is their resort fee? ....is there pool open and what restrictions do they have due to the COVID virus? ....what are the restrictions and changes they have made with regard to the virus, things that are different? I‚Äôd hope quite a bit. .....Will they be willing to share details about what different things they do to clean their rooms and bathrooms for their guests? Again, I‚Äôd expect a lot. .....Finally if it was me, I‚Äôd ask if they would promise that they will ONLY put me in a room that has NOT been occupied for three days or more. This gives you a bit more protection with regard to the virus. Sorry I took the liberty of adding the extra points beyond your question...but this is the approach that we are taking now. This Westin is a fine hotel. I have stayed there on and off over 25 years, primarily in January for the Consumer Electronics Show....and have always been pleased. Good luck!",1
6974,salsherr,Jun 2020,"hi, when we was there on 31st october 2019 we was charged 85 dollars, maybe it was for the two of us? The pool might be closed due to the corona virus but things are opening up more, might be a good idea to email them to ask about the info, that way you have it in writing if someone charges you a different price, we emailed for a room high up and at the back, we was pleasantly surprised on arrival that we got one, we loved it there and would definitely stay again, enjoy...",0
6974,karol452,Jun 2020,There us no members lounge. When I was there the pool was closed due to weather. There is a resort fee,0
6975,PopeFracis,Apr 2020,$37 a day and i forget exactly what it covers besides a whiskey tasting and possibly a dessert in the restaurant,0
6975,Smitty09876,Apr 2020,"Generally the answer above seems to ring a bell as to our experience. However, and particularly now with the COVID-19 pandemic effect and Las Vegas shutting down for a while, it is really imperative that you call the Westin to get very accurate information for your trip. Ask to speak to the concierge and they will give you the straight up info but also ask for her/his name so that when you check in, you can make sure that what you thought you heard is exactly what you are getting. Enjoy! P.S. If you are going there for a few days or even longer, make sure you visit the web site for the Las Vegas monorail. You can buy passes on line for one, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 UNLIMITED rides per pass. It is a great deal if you are going to do exploring, particularly since a single ride cost $5 no matter how far or short you ride.",0
6975,salsherr,Apr 2020,"It was around 85 dollars, check what it covers at the desk as some staff dont give you full details, we got whiskey taster each evening at 5.30, a free dessert from the restraunt each evening, use of pool and robes, a couple of other things but always check with reception the morning after incase anything has changed..hope a little info is ok.. Because we wasnt told these things on checking in at night time a lovely receptionist give us vouchers for the buffet breakfast for 2 mornings, some reception staff go beyond their duties to help, we would most certainly stay there again...",0

6979,Thelma W,Jun 2019,I'm quiet sure you'd still have to pay resort fee.,0
6979,A Tripadvisor Member,Mar 2019,You have to pay the resort fees. I have never had them waived so I am not sure how they can be avoided. I was told that it's separate to the hotel that's why the fees are separate.,0
6979,Doug D,Mar 2019,"Yes, you have to pay the resort fee, but they waived mine on the morning of departure because there was no hot water for the shower. We booked the room as part of a flight/hotel package and we were upgraded to a corner room based on my status which was a pleasant surprise given that third party bookings can be an issue sometimes.",0
6979,jmoccia,Mar 2019,"Yes the resort fee is for using the facilities - gym, pool , shuttle service, etc. so no matter how you pay there is still resort fee",0

6980,angie s,Mar 2019,"No, they remodeled the whole downstairs. This is why I liked it there because you‚Äôre around all these machines 24/7 so going back to this hotel it was quiet.

6984,XaghraDream,Nov 2018,"In truth, very little. You cannot opt out of the resort fee, so best include it in your room rate without thinking about it. Many Vegas Hotels have the same set-up. It's rather annoying as the headline room rates do not include it. Westin is 'free' parking though, so that is a bonus. I think the fee is $36.28 a night, inc. tax.",0

6999,Molly H,Aug 2017,The remodel caused no issue in out stay. Part of the lobby was blocked off but it was not noisy or unsightly at all. It is still easy to locate all that you would find in a hotel lobby.,0

Why spend much money on a room you will hardly spend any time in? Regarding safety, I was there alone ( 50 YO female) and I walked all over the place by myself. Always people around you and plenty of policemen. Another benefit, one of the Big Red Bus pick ups is right across the street!",0
7027,Luv2Vacation63,Nov 2015,"The Westin is definitely a closer walk to the Bellagio or Caesars than it would be from Circus Circus or Luxor. As for the safety, if you asked me a year ago, I would have said no, that I didn't feel safe walking back from the Bellagio to the Westin by myself. When I was at the Westin in July, I found that a new ""pedestrian walkway"" was built next to the Flamingo with LOTS of restaurants and stores; and, this walkway takes you right to the new Sky Wheel attraction. The Westin sits right behind this Sky Wheel so when I took this way back from the strip, I felt a whole lot safer. However, note, that there is still that walk from the Wheel to the Westin which can feel not entirely safe but on the whole I felt safer than I ever did in the past. I have no recommendations on the ""better room"" so hopefully someone can help you with that.",0

The main road is very busy and not safe to walk at night. We drove approx 2K east and found a Village Inn diner (terrible service). The hotel is VERY VERY noisy. The planes take off and land directly overhead. There are ear plugs provided on the nightstand. If you wear them, it might dampen the niose? They were uncomfortable and fell out of my ears. We woud never stay there again. If there's any way you can change your reservations go to the Embassy Suites Hilton on Swenson Avenue. It's close to the airport but quieter and so much nicer! You can walk or get a free shuttle to the strip with lots of places to eat. They also have the best made-to-order breakfast included.",0

I would strongly suggest that you contact the hotel directly to see what their policy is. My first choice would be to communicate via email so that I would have their answer in writing.

It's part of the Deuce Bus system (but only stops at specific Deuce bus stops) but your Deuce ticket is fully valid on it. Ten Deuce bus is double decker, the SDX bus is single story that bends in the middle. It has a gold stripe that runs along its paintwork. Hope this helps. Enjoy.",1

I don't believe there is a courtesy shuttle to strip, Gold Coast or Orleans, but there may be one to Sam's Town (leaving from California casino - I believe). Ask MSS front desk. About 1 block East and 1 block North go under the highway overpass.... is the Old Mormon Fort Museum and the Neon Museum. Walkable and not as bad as a walk to the Strip",0

Buy a rnd trip tkt to your hotel,,, prices are posted... Hotels in the old downtown are about $18.50 rnd trip. I use Bells Trans,,,, any will do. Also you may be able to get tkts even more cheaply on line... You'll print off your tkt at home... I haven't done that yet.....",0
7190,John G,Feb 2015,"There are a number of competing airport shuttles. They all charge about the same amount and provide roughly similar services. The fare is the same when going from a downtown hotel to the airport and vice-versa, and there are round-trip fares that are a little bit less than two one-way fares. None of them will take you straight from your hotel to the airport or vice-versa... they all drop off or pick up passengers along the way. Downtown riders are often the last to be dropped off and the first to be picked up, giving them the lowest quality of service even though the fare to and from downtown is higher (it is farther away).",0

7192,4everBuds,Dec 2014,"No, unfortunately Main Street does not have free WiFi. And, the hotel also took out the free WiFi access in the lobby. There is a daily charge of $9.99 for WiFi if you want access in your room for 24 hours. Sometimes, we pay the fee if we really need access to the Internet and we'll be in the room for a long period of time. We figure that $9.99/24 hrs. is pretty good since normally $10 doesn't last you on a machine for a long time, unless of course... you're really lucky! And, that could happen! Given the warm hotel atmosphere, good service, free hotel guest parking (w/ in'n out privileges), good food!...sometimes it's okay for us to pay for WiFi access!",1

Now it has been 5 years since the last time we were out for it, so things may have changed. Contact the main desk at MSS and they should be able to give the full low down. Also, and keep this between us, a little before midnight, go over to the Golden Nuggets self parking lot and go up to the top floor. When they start the fire works you will be able to see most of it. That is a great view unless your hotel room is up high and faces south. They block off Fremont and part of the strip and if you do not have a wrist band, you are not privy to a lot of craziness that happens on the inside. Believe me, you want one, discounted or not.",0

The man who makes the omelettes in the morning really puts on a show. He's been a staple there for quite a few years. He always makes us smile. Also the all you can eat crab legs on Friday night is great! If you plan on going for the crab legs, make sure you get there at least 30 minutes before they open for dinner, because people start lining up and that line gets very long, very quickly. But It's worth the wait.... Enjoy",0

7198,travelgirl1960,Sep 2014,"Your questions...from the best of my knowledge, and at this late date. As mentioned in other comments, you really should call the property. Especially with less than two weeks to book now, and on a weekend - don't rely on this forum. Having said that - here's what I believe to be true. Properties will not allow pets in the hotel unless it is a service animal, which requires documentation. HOWEVER - be aware that Paris Hilton's purse dog can be a service animal, if it promotes a needed mental/emotional health boost and the guest can prove it. I've seen people gambling with their purse dog sitting at their feet, on a satin pillow. REALLY?!??! Main Street Station appears booked for your days in mind. Other options, the Plaza, next door - nice rooms, request high strip-view for the best lookouts...Around $120 per night for your weekend getaway. If you're flying in, try Hotwire or Expedia for a last minute package. Know that most properties have a resort fee if you are NOT using comp coupons earned via the player's clubs. MainStreet is a cool place with good food and interesting gaming. One of a kind downtown...but don't be scared to venture elsewhere! Downtown's a blast!",0

The bathrooms were very odd; the shower had no doors and the whole bathroom got soaking wet when you took a shower. The pool is very small at the hotel.

Since you have booked directly with an owner you may be subject to additional cleaning fees upon your request for service or specific additional items (towels, robes, etc.). A transient hotel guest room is cleaned daily unless they tell us otherwise. Generally, guests staying in owner units will pay a fee for each individual service dependent on the room type you are staying in. Resort fees are not charged to owner units. Wifi usage is the same configuration as other guest rooms. Yes, you do have access to swim in both the Palms and Palms Place pool areas. Palms pool does currently have weekend pool parties that do charge cover after noon typically but is discounted for hotel guests.

It is in the old Downtown (Fremont Street-area) of Las Vegas. This area attracts people of area 50+. If you're a 20 or 30-something this isn't the primary area for you.

To visit the Strip, you have to travel south of downtown but Fremont Street is a block away. Great place to walk around. It is difficult walking the Strip because of the distances between properties.

7451,Chris L,Jul 2014,"Well, we had a rental car. Although it is on the main drag of the strip it is way down. - closer to downtown and the old las vegas - fremont area. It would be a very long walk up to the newer hotels. But this is what we wanted as we were headed North out of town - and I wanted the car right outside my door, vs having to spend 1/2 getting to it. It was in a patrolled lot and we indeed felt safe. We will be staying there again. Prolly 3-4 miles from the airport Im guessing....take a cab. You can also take a cab up the strip if needed. I hope this helps. Keep a cab service number in your phone or have the desk call. There is a good deal of traffic so im sure there is no problem getting on....a major wedding chapel is right next door.",1
7451,Kyle F,Jul 2014,"Iryna, It is not close to the strip. If you want to go to the strip, where all of the shopping, gambling, eating, shows, etc. are it is about 6 miles away. We did not use a rental car, but we did use taxi services. It can be very pricy to use a taxi, so I don't recommend it. You also have to fight to wave one down. This hotel is in a more run-down not nice area of the city on the outside of the Las Vegas attractions areas. The point of Las Vegas is the strip, so my suggestion is do not stay here if you're making a big trip out of it and will be traveling to and from the trip. Taxi services, bus, etc. will be too expensive and a big inconvenience for you. Las Vegas gets extremely hot too, so you don't want to walk that far in the heat (very strong sun). It was my first and only time there, so I'm sorry if this isn't very helpful. I strongly, strongly recommend staying closer to the strip, especially if you're traveling from far/outside the US. Good luck and enjoy your trip!!",1

7480,chris_cy_gm,Apr 2015,"Hi Rick, The Summerlin Courtyard, 1901 N Rainbow Blvd, is approximately 16 miles from McCarran airport. I am not pesonally knowldedgeable of how Citizens Area Transit (CAT) works in Las Vegas but I was able find some information on their website. Their note says ""You can find their new web site at rtcsouthernnevada dot When I entered the link it said it was not available but I was able to click on topics in the heading such as ""Transit"" which took me to drop down boxes for more information -Airport Transit Routes, etc- Traveling to McCarran International Airport? Route 108, Route 109, and the Westcliff Airport Express all stop at the airport‚Äôs Ground Level Zero at Terminal 1. If you are traveling to Terminal 3 you can now take the Centennial Express and the Westcliff Airport Express. Please note that the Centennial Express only goes to Terminal 3. Download our Airport Park & Ride Airport Guide for information about all transit route schedules at McCarran International Airport. You can also access the airport on the Strip & Downtown Express by going to the South Strip Transfer Terminal (SSTT) and riding Route 109 straight there. To plan a trip online, use the Google Transit Trip Planner located on our home page. At the airport, purchase transit passes using the Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) located at the bus stops on Level Zero of Terminal 1 and 3. TVMs only accept Visa or MasterCard credit/debit cards. Alternately, you can purchase your pass when you board the vehicle. Please have exact change ready. The Westcliff annex is the closest to us- approx. 1.5-2 miles away.
