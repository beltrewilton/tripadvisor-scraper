3,wkim412,Jul 7,"I never tried that, but you can call hotel to ask. Asian teppanyaki and other $75 extra for each person restaurant( I did not try) you have to make a reservation. Other restaurants you will be free to go without reserving. BUT asian restaurant you still can go if you don't sit for teppanyaki. ( I was very disappointed this restaurant food though...too salty and not salty enough... other restaurants were good) have fun!!!",0
4,Greg,Jul 6,"Yes - room service is included and they have hours for breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus - then an after hours menu for late night snacks - the cheeseburger was amazing one late night!!!",0
4,John L,Jul 6,Yes. Plus you can call the night before and have them deliver breakfast at a specific time,0
5,Darlita1959,Jul 6,I think in the Past you could but i believe they have stopped that. Also Great place to have a Wedding we had friends do one last month. Check out the pic of weddings on the Zilara facebook.,0

11,richard r,Jun 2022,Beach cabanas are first come first serve. Certain cabanas close to the pool have a surcharge.,0
11,John B,Jun 2022,When is our first come first served at when we were there in March there was not a problem finding an empty one. Just get there early,0
11,NorthStar45540956893,Jun 2022,"We were there in May in an Oceanfront King suite. They didn't say it was included, though when we were there, there was not a problem getting a beach cabana and we were usually able to secure an ""unpaid for"" pool cabana..... otherwise you can book a cabana for like $34",0
11,travelfun044,Jun 2022,"So, we were there the first week of June 2022. I walked the beach to check this because there were so many mixed comments. The highest level room does, I think Presidential. Swim ups used to. Some of the cabanas are still marked with a swim up room number, I think they just haven't taken all the numbers down. That being said, we NEVER had an issue finding a beach cabana.",0
11,JD W,Jun 2022,"Hi, To the best of my knowledge, OF Luxury Suites include a beach cabana. We have never used ours but have gone down for a beach walk and found our room # on ours. If your not sure, just ask the concierge. They help with EVERYTHING.",0
12,Amanda H,Jun 2022,We were there last week and the foam party was on Friday- so much fun!,0
13,NorthStar45540956893,Jun 2022,We booked an Ocean FRONT king suite and our view was directly at the beautiful ocean. We stayed on the 6th floor and the room had a double hot tub jacuzzi we utilized almost every night too. I recommend leaving the curtains open to enjoy the view and stars from your tub!,1
14,R S,May 2022,It was fine at Hyatt Zilara on 28/29 April 2022. I was able to be on the beach and swim in sea there. It’s more of a problem further south in Playa del Carmen.,1
15,Keith B,May 2022,"Let me preface by stating that collecting and drinking wine is my primary hobby, so I had to alter my expectations going into the trip. We stayed last week - drank mostly the house Sauvignon Blanc - nothing special, maybe a touch sweet instead of more acidic. Only other one I tried was a carmenere, which I only tried once as I didn't care for it. The markups on the wines were astronomical - I understand there are VAT, etc., but even for something mediocre like Prisoner, it was $6,800mx. At restaurants around here it's like $80USD, not $340USD.",1
15,Susie S,May 2022,"My husband and I felt like the house wines weren’t bad and were comparable to many house wines in the states. We both drink Cabernets and Chardonnays, so I cannot say anything about Pinot Grigio or White Zinfandel.",1
15,Kelly G,May 2022,"Hey have Not improved, the house wines or otherwise. See my recentvreview. :)",0
16,SummerGirl8888,Apr 2022,"I just returned from the Zilara as my first international trip since the start of covid. I found things similar to what others have said--masking on staff is 100%, guests are much less reliable most places, (we chose to mask up out of respect for the posted signs saying it was mandatory inside). To add to what the others have said, the staff was doing a remarkable job at cleaning constantly. There are sanitizer stations at the entrances to each restaurant and a shoe cleaning station. They offer an on-site insurance package for a very small fee (which to me means they are doing all they can to keep guests healthy during their stay), and they have on-site testing available for free or at a discount (depending on length of stay and type of test needed). All said, it felt very safe! The quality of service, food, and amenities was unchanged compared to my 2 prior visits pre-pandemic.",1
17,HFW,Apr 2022,"In the past, yes. However, during Covid the practice was suspended.Last time I asked, they had not reinstated it. Not sure when you are traveling, but I will be staying at both Zilara and Ziva next week and am happy to ask multiple concierge at both resorts for you (to get a consistent response).",1

22,Roberto G,Mar 2022,Yes! I recommend booking with Viator. They pick you up really early from the hotel and return you in the evening.,0
22,Tracy D,Mar 2022,I believe tours and excursions can be arranged at the resort with concierge.,0
22,benluis08,Mar 2022,They have an excursion office that helps plan those day trips at an extra cost. We personally didn’t look into it but I’m sure they do.,0

25,scandalsharon,Feb 2022,The covid test is included....no charge,0
25,Kelly G,Feb 2022,"No charge. But, they try to sell you Insurance at check in....",0
25,Amanda M,Feb 2022,"It’s actually free to my knowledge. If you have a dr note of recently having it you don’t have to get tested, otherwise they explain all the details on where to go on the 2nd floor and it’s a really easy process. You test the day before and they email you results by that night. At the check in process you can also fill out a form if you were to test positive you pay $60 some I want to say and that would cover the stay of the time you would have to quarantine. From my knowledge the positivity rate is very very low. We were a group of 35 and either people had a dr note or tested negative.",0
26,Amy G,Feb 2022,Our room was in the NE corner of the building. There did appear to be a loft style room beside the building that was part of Zilara (same patio furniture and loungers). I assumed it was the Presidential Suite. If you are interested in it the Concierge may have more information.,0
28,Fareed Khimani,Mar 2022,For two persons. but we had 2 queen beds and my son (23 yrs old) accompanied with us. you may have to get approval prior to booking.,0
29,Fareed Khimani,Mar 2022,I don't think they allow 4 people to share one room,0
30,Fareed Khimani,Mar 2022,All room has Jacuzzi and hammock,1
30,Lara,Feb 2022,"All rooms are suites and have jetted tubs but there are 2 types of hammocks, if you have a balcony big enough they have the regular hammock but if your balcony is too small for that, they have a chair type hammock. I personally like to lay on the hammock and watch the sunrise so your best bet is a room with a big balcony. You can always specify request like this in your room reservation",1
30,Kimberly H,Feb 2022,"Yes, I believe all rooms have jacuzzi and hammock. We didn't upgrade our rooms either time in November or January and both had jacuzzi and hammock. My husband took a long nap during a rainstorm on the hammock and didn't get wet.",1
30,Mark,Feb 2022,"Yes all the rooms are ocean front, jacuzzi tubs and Hammocks",1
30,Tim M,Feb 2022,All rooms are suites and have the jetted tubs as far as I am aware. I believe all have the hammock as long as it has a balcony/patio. There maybe a few rooms that don't. It's clearly listed on the room details on the Hyatt site.,1
30,ltl_leah,Feb 2022,"All rooms are suites, so yes, all rooms have a jacuzzi and hammock. They do have these rooms called villas in a separate building. They all have jacuzzi's, but I'm unsure about the hammocks with those rooms.",1
30,anne s,Feb 2022,There's a very weak ( and hard to get warm enough) jet tub in the room. I don't recall if there was a hammock. We stayed in a swim up Ocean view suite,0
30,Tracy D,Feb 2022,I do not have an answer for this sorry!,0

34,ltl_leah,Feb 2022,"To my knowledge, you can smoke on the beach but not at the pool. I believe they have designated smoking areas at the resort to smoke. I know of 2 outdoor areas outside the sports bar and the Den that are specifically for smoking cigars.",0
37,F D,Mar 2022,"Im currently here for spring break. Not too crowded, plenty of beach and pool cabanas. They said they are currently at 75% capacity. All the restaurants are open.",0
38,Fareed Khimani,Mar 2022,Mask required only when you enter into the restaurants for dining,0
39,Caitlin Guerra,Feb 2022,I stayed 3 nights and got the test for free. Not bad at all. You fill out a paper (need to bring passport for this) and they do the testing right away. Got our results within less than the 12 hours promised.,0

40,Tami M,Nov 2021,I saw people smoking cigars on the beach.,0
40,Sandy M,Nov 2021,"I do not know, I am a non smoker.",0
40,Sandy V,Nov 2021,I have no idea. I never saw anyone smoking at all. If you call them they will answer that question.,0
40,Arlene R,Nov 2021,I do not know the correct answer but while I was there I did not see one person smoking there.,0
41,Rob,Nov 2021,"There are no set pool hours, entertainment was done in the main hotel area, mostly local dancing, etc. no bands or anything like that while we were there",0
42,anne s,Nov 2021,"not sure, looks externally mostly done. likely awhile yet.... The temporary spot has a really nice gazebo right on the water so you can feel the breeze and hear the waves breaking which is WAY nice. The other part isn't as nice, and the cooking area, greeting area, etc do feel cobbled together. ignore that tho.....",1

46,Tim M,Nov 2021,"The beach is one of the nicest stretches in Cancun. I would be cautious of the riptide and current in the water. They seem to have a combination of red and yellow flags out each day. On the windier days, the waves tend to be a bit bigger.",1
46,Climber44794925393,Oct 2021,"This stretch of shoreline can get quite windy, so many adjacent resorts will have out red flags quite often. Where the Zilara is seems a little more reliable for at least yellow flag conditions -- which means you can swim, but use caution. There are strong riptides, so read up on what to do if you get caught in a current like that. The water is clear, the sand is glorious and cleaned diligently by hotel staff. Not rocky at all. The worst we've had happen in two stays to date is a needlefish coming in close to shore, so they had to get everyone out of the water for a few hours!",1
46,Mark,Oct 2021,"It was great during our stay, the beach is great very clean. And yes the water is swimmable",1
46,ryan7578,Oct 2021,"Beach is perfect, there is a little sea weed here and there but not bad at all. There were raking it up with a tractor so was mostly gone. Bottom at beach was all sand with little to no rocks. It was calm most of the time we where there. Very swimmable for sure.",1
47,Joe,Oct 2021,"The luxury room is a little bigger, you have a wrap around balcony, & you get a free bottle of alcohol. You also get your own personal cabana on the beach & access to the fancy restaurant Chef's Plate. I know this for a fact, just stayed in a luxury suite in May. 😊",3
47,Katy R,Oct 2021,"Does one of them sit in a corner, so that you get MORE views of the ocean? If so, that was what we had and I loved the extra views and light! I think that room, too, comes with access to the spa. *Note, this does not mean FREE treatments at the spa, just access to it and its hydrotherpy ritual. I got a treatment at the spa - paid for it - and did the ritual - free because of my room and bc I had a service done - which was lovely. But TBH, I was ready to get back outside to the pool and beach. To me, that's where the relaxation was at, not the spa. So get the special room for the views and not bc you get free access to the spa ritual.",2
47,Ladell W,Oct 2021,We had the regular Jr. Suite and it was plenty big. Our friends had the luxury suite and the got a bottle of alcohol and a cabana right next to the pool edge. But we also had a poolside cabana.,1
47,LAURAPEOPLES2021,Oct 2021,"Hi, Congratulations on getting married! We were married at the Hyatt Zilara and go back as often as possible. All the rooms are lovely. The upgraded room will be higher up floors. Honestly, all the rooms are spacious and have gorgeous views. I would suggest not being in the middle of the resort. Sometimes it's a louder bunch at the pool. The front desk people are very helpful and will do everything they can to make your honeymoon special. cheers!",1
47,Julia D,Nov 2021,"We were just there and reserved that same room. No extra perks other than a bottle of liquor in your room, which we didn’t even open because they didn’t bring us any mixers. No beach cabana or pool cabana. Now all the beach cabanas are paid or reserved for presidential suites and maybe the swim up rooms and half of the pool cabanas are paid. Sorry to say, not too many perks for the extra $300 we paid. I wouldn’t pay that for a wrap around balcony and one bottle of liquor. But that’s up to you!",0
47,McMarshal,Oct 2021,"To clarify -- the room is slightly larger. You do get a wrap-around balcony, but the wrap-around part is too narrow to be of use. What it does mean is that you don't have a neighbour on that side, wink wink, nudge nudge. The reserved beach cabana is a really nice perk, and the Chef's table dinner is also a perk -- you can reserve that when you arrive on site. As for the free bottle... it's wine, and it's horrible, and you can order that from room service anyway. The other upgrades are where the value is.",0
47,Sandy V,Oct 2021,We had the Junior King room and it was spacious and very comfortable. Highly recommend it. We were on the fifth floor and had a great ocean view. We were one unit from the end and it was perfect only one couple walked past our door. The balcony had great views for sunrise and out the front door great sunsets over the lagoon.,0
47,The Everyday A,Oct 2021,I believe the luxury suite has a swim up pool so it’s on the lower level. We stayed in a regular king suite and it was AMAZING!,0
47,DOREEN P,Oct 2021,I'm pretty sure it is because there are a few rooms which may have an obstructed ocean view so if you upgrade you won't run into that issue and I believe it gets you to a higher floor as well.,-1
47,Jessi Swanson,Oct 2021,"Every room has a view of the ocean. The luxury suite will get you extra perks like a reserved beach cabana and larger balcony. We have been here several times and usually get the ocean view suite and it has been lovely. However, we are coming in Dec and went with the Luxury suite this time.",-1
48,Tim M,Nov 2021,"No long pants are required for men. They suggest bermuda shorts. As for the pools being heated, we were there the end of October when it was in the 80s and found the water to be refreshingly cool. Not sure if there is a need to heat them. You can check out the hours, menus and dress code for all the restaurants here: zilaracancun resortsbyhyatt (put dots between and com at the end)",0

51,Gregory I,Oct 2021,I believe you can get a roll out bed sent to your room.,0
52,Jules,Jul 3,"There is a main pool and then a pool for kids in a different area. Some of the rooms also have infinity pools connected to them, though they are all pretty nice. And then there is also easy access to the beach if that is more your style.",1
53,Chris L,Jun 2022,"This hotel had a Covid-19 testing center in May 2022, so I think yes they still have it. You must bring your passport to book an appointment first so that you can assign any time slot you want. You can ask where it is when you check-in and I recommend you to make an appointment as soon as you checkin. They provided both antigen and PCR test at that time. I did antigen test at 10 am but got a result at/after 6 pm so you may want to consider this turnaround time for your schedule. Even though you schedule at specific time, you might need to wait for around 30 min before sample collection.",0

56,JD W,Jun 2022,"Hello, the “seaweed” is strange and we have yet to find someone who can explain its behavior. You may have a few straight days of minimal, then like magic.. the next day, NONE. Whether it’s tide related, seasonal, weather affected or what, it varies from day to day. So someone there RIGHT NOW May say there’s NONE, and by morning it’s globs. And what’s even more odd, is it might be in a short spread directly out from line of pool and yet hardly any just to one side or the other. But, the resorts do their best to have tractors out there every morning.",0
56,Anthony C,Jun 2022,"There was almost no seaweed on the beach or in the water right now, not sure if that’s normal or it was pushed out with the latest tropical storm that passed through",0

60,H S,May 2022,Only if you want to eat at the Italian place because it is so small. Not a lot of tables so you will need a reservation or be prepared to be on the waitlist and eat at 9 or 10 pm for dinner.,0
60,Layla,May 2022,No it’s not essential! Sometimes when they fill up they take a waiting list however if you keep track of when they first open you’re fine! Even if you are super hungry and don’t want to wait the 30-45 min there’s so many fast options that are fresh and delicious:),0

198,Andrew B,Aug 2021,I was swimming 4 out of 5 days. 1 day had too much seaweed.,2
198,Donna Diana,Aug 2021,"Yes, you can swim. Waves can be rough on red flag days. But we went out pass the crashing part of the wave and it was wonderful.",2

198,Delma C,Aug 2021,"I don’t swim in the ocean but I do see people out there swimming! I just walk to the edge, get my feet wet!",0
198,Shawn H,Aug 2021,I don’t “swim” I just get out a bit and jump the waves but you probably could swim if you wanted. Seaweed is hit or miss in the 5 times I have been here. Most of the time it’s not a big problem I don’t see why you couldn’t snorkel,0
198,cherry127,Aug 2021,Yes you can swim. Seaweed was bad on my Day 1 due to hurricane heading towards area...day 3 after the hurricane the water was nice and clean...hotel did great job cleaning up after the storm. Waves were rough though; as expected given the storm.,0
199,Jessica C,Aug 2021,"Masks required everywhere, loosely worn by patrons at the pool but other than the pool, patrons wear them. Employees pretty good at enforcing from what I saw. Employees are always wearing masks everywhere (inside and outside).",2
200,Sylvia S,Aug 2021,A few are outside on the beach but there’s also a few that are inside and have AC. The restaurant that you should checkout inside are MB and Siete. Very good food!!,2
202,Robynn S,Yesterday,"It probably depends on where you’re at, but likely no the swim out doesn’t stay sunny all day. We had an oceanfront swim out and it was full sun until about 2.",0
202,Robynn S,Yesterday,"Definitely is not a party hotel. More chill, relaxed vibe. They do activities every evening and have a DJ until 1am or something like that. So just depends on what your idea of a party place is.",0
202,sandy e,Jul 6,Do the ocean front swim outs stay sunny all day or do you need to move to the main pool at some point to get sun?,0
203,Robert T,Jul 1,Yes. Corona and Corona Light. Plus lots of Modelo,4
206,Starr H,Jun 2022,"IMO it's a hotel for people 30s and up, who are looking for a chill time. Yes there's a DJ for one of the pools, but I didn't see ONE person really drunk in the pool or stumbling around, and that's usually a constant thing at a Mexican All Inclusive. I found it was a lot of couples, or groups of friends in their 40s. I absolutely loved it because my husband and I were there to chill out and reconnect, not party and that's exactly what we got. But there was a guy walking down the beach asking if we wanted to buy weed daily, but stopped after no one showed interest.",0
207,Meoshe L,Jun 2022,"Yes, on their website there is Amstar. My husband and I booked a shuttle when booking our hotel stay.",2

207,c0urtneyw22,Jun 2022,I used AmStar and booked a private car but they also offer shuttle services. They have a representative on site at the resort which is convenient for any last minute changes. But you can book transportation through a link on the resort's web page as well.,1
207,Starr H,Jun 2022,I went on expedia and booked a private shuttle for my husband and I. It was $60 for both ways (I paid ahead of time) and we booked through Shuttle Central.,0
207,James L,Jun 2022,I called the hotel and they have an on-site travel company that was excellent,0
207,hairdivaOhio,Jun 2022,USA Transfers is great. The resort is only 15-16 minutes from the airport. If another traveler took a 45 minute cab ride they were taken advantage of!,0
207,HowardThorman2021,Jun 2022,Who ever you book thought should have included transportation in your package. So if you book with example FunJet once you exit the air port go to a person holding a FunJet sign and they should take care of you. Or ask any of the people out there very nice folks.,0
207,Candy T,Jun 2022,The resort does not provide transportation. We made a reservation with Cancun Vans & it was around $30 per person for round trip. The airport is about 15 min away.,0
207,bighub99,Jun 2022,When I booked the trip the shuttle service was provide by a third party. It was very reasonable we stated stated 6 days and the transportation form cancun airport was to and from was 116.00,0

209,Darla B,Jun 2022,"Yes, but I'd use Amstar or Kalido transfers for a cheaper and safer alternative",0
210,Doug H,May 2022,"I enjoy cigars so I looked for the best place to do that. They informed me that smoking as not allowed on our patio, although we saw a couple of people doing it. We did not see anyone smoke at any of the pools. They have an outdoor bar located next to the long pool that allows smoking. It is a terrific area with nice furniture and a bar right there. Every evening, there is a DJ playing music in the bar also. Once a week they also have tequila tasting. A very nice place to hang out.",1
211,anthonyserrano1020,May 2022,24/7 food delivery usually takes about 40-60 minutes when ordered,2
217,Jessica M,May 2022,I'd try to upgrade before you get there. We tried to upgrade once we got to the resort and they did not have this option available.,1
218,Dennis L,May 2022,Smoking did not appear to be tightly controlled.,1
219,Starr H,Jun 2022,If you tip well at the beginning for the day....you'll get the BEST service all day long!,1

Serenity Romance Suites would be in one of the these 3 buildings only with additional amenities including special dinner, in-room sparkling wine, chocolate dipped strawberries, etc. Regular romance swim-out suites would be by the quiet or round pool with the special amenities like dinner, in-room food and wine, etc. Regular rooms are more likely to be in buildings 2, 3, or 4, not oceanfront. No private check-in, no special dinner, no special in-room amenities.",3
227,Troy R,Apr 2022,I agree with aarnold20 I have no clue what the romance is? What I can tell you is there was plenty of romance in the ocean front swim out suite (wink wink),0
227,aarnold2022,Apr 2022,Im not sure about the difference between the serentiy romance or serenity but I would highly recommend getting a swim out ocean front! You wont be dissapointed,0

239,wahnduh,Apr 2022,"We only stayed a week and only did one excursion to Chichen Itza (ancient ruins) We wanted to relax so didn't plan any other excursions. It is a very relaxed resort and if you get bored easy, then do more excursions.",0
239,megadn n,Apr 2022,I was getting a little stir crazy by day 4---two weeks is too long at this resort. Some other ones have more entertainment but Haven is very very chill.,0
240,Lauren F,Mar 2022,"Hi, Haven did have entertainment, there are two pools at the resort one is louder and then there is the calmer pool. In the louder pool at around 12-1Pm everyday a DJ was playing music and more people gathered in the pool usually near the pool bar or playing water volleyball. There is an entertainment team getting people to join games and the louder pool throughout the day. At night they have a DJ set up outside near the louder pool and bar. They also have a night club that has shows and parties every night. It definitely wasn't a party resort though. There weren't too many guests staying at the resort so not as many people out at night compared to other resorts I have been to. I think the hotel tries to not crowd the resort so they don't ever have it fully booked. If entertainment is your #1 priority I might look at other resorts. Hope this helps!",1
241,Jen F,Mar 2022,No unfortunately there isn’t. Although they did have elevators in main building that allow guests to get to restaurants easily. As far as walking around I would ask for a room located close to main building as well.,0

243,sherslavin,Mar 2022,"There is one main store that has sundry items and some clothes, flip-flops hats handbags accessories etc. it is quite a trip into town. Probably a 30 or $40 cab ride. There are other hotels around, but we didn’t go to any of them so I’m not sure.",1
243,Katie L,Mar 2022,The shop was the only thing that was lacking at the resort! We bought suveniors at the airport instead.,1
243,Hilary N,Mar 2022,"There are yes, but more for clothes than snacks and drinks. I believe the shop sells cigarettes but probably at a higher rate than elsewhere. The nearest shop will be towards Cancun about 20 mins away.",1

243,Tlpgoody,Mar 2022,They have a small gift shop. To have the basics like sundries and flip-flops and beach cover-ups and some other resort wear a little bit of jewelry some suntan lotions some other little knickknacks.

Wait in line if there is one..chairs. Bring your passport. (very comfortable)You are given the test, wait there if you want and you get the results in 15 minutes. Paper copy, and a e-mail.

It takes anywhere from 15 mins to 45 mins depending upon the day and line. they provide printed and electronic results. Very easy. They use an empty hotel room next to an outside walkway bridge so if there is a line they have chairs set out. They swab on one side of your nose - no swirling - just a deep entry!! Very quick and efficient,1
248,Sherpa446968,Mar 2022,They swab. I was there last week 2/27 nad they had not had 1 positive for 10 days.,0

308,Laura P,Oct 2021,"Hello, Yes, we did see beds on the beach. Don't quote me on this price, but I believe it was 1900 pesos for the day. There was a sign, but we did not use them. There are plenty of normal lounge chairs, and we never had a problem getting a chair. There is a little coffee spot in the hotel. They had a machine that made coffees like cappuccino etc. It was not an espresso machine, but good coffee nonetheless and no extra cost. Hope this helps!",0
308,dorae0503,Oct 2021,Yes they have Bali beds. I don’t remember the price but I remember it being pricey. They do have a coffee shop,0

I thought it was worth it, we also got 40% off at the spa, beach dinner included along with the French. private area on the beach with top shelf liquor and wine. 3 bottles to the room (wegot grey goose). unlimited Champagne to the room. 4 hours babysitting for free (used for the French dinner since kids aren't allowed). 11th floor private lounge with food all day, drinks, gorgeous view and conceinge service that makes all the bookings for you. also got free tix for the ferry. there was more too I just can't remember. if I was to go again, I would 100% do the upgrade.",3
314,Cynthia E,Feb 2022,"We had a great time without the package. Lots of great restaurants near by, you get free tickets to the ferry on Tuesdays you just need to sign up at the pool concierge. I bought 2 bottles for us and just asked for specific liquors. Had the beach dinner and a couples massage too. The liquor selection was not that great. We are used to Premium liquor and actually found a better selection outside the hotel. We spent less than it would have cost with the Infinite package. You can always upgrade later during your trip if you go up to the VIP lounge and speak to the concierge there. May offer you a discount since you are existing guests.",0
314,FrequentFlier629921,Sep 2021,in this hotel to buy all inclusive package is not worth it!!! there are fine restaurants nearby where you will get everything better good luck and enjoy your stay,-1

315,anikkogorham,Sep 2021,"Yes, when we was there all restaurants were all inclusive. You have to make reservations for some of the restaurants typically a 24 hour notice for maybe 2 of the restaurants. It was by far one of the best properties in Cancun. Also, the hotel offers free ferry round trip tickets to get to the island (Isla Mujeres) if you stay at least three nights if Im not mistaken. The rooms are very spacious and you are within walking distance to CoCo Bongo. It is definitely a 5 Star Hotel.",0

The main pool area is where most of the kids were because its close to dolphins, food, and the beach with the kayaks and snorkel gear. There is the Turquoise only pool you can’t use. And then there is the pool near the south beach. I would expect it to have fewer kids because its more low key. Be aware, There are a lot of weddings and at times it may limit access to some areas due to receptions.",0

332,James H,Apr 2022,Kids yes but not too many. Groups seem to self select to adult areas and kid areas. Lots for kids to do in pool so they sort of self select. Same is true for beach. I agree that main pool attracts more families and other pool has fewer kids. We did not feel kids were a problem at all.......lots of room.,0

334,Anani M,Jul 9,"There are many cabanas in various locations and prices depending on food options and bottle service. But honestly our favorite were the chairs on the beach with the thatch roofs. They are free, in the sand with a nice view of the ocean , and close to the main pools. Just make sure to pick out your seats before 10am. They have a policy that towels will be removed if left for 1 hour, so if you see a seat with a towel really early in the morning and no guest in sight for a long time, you can ask staff to clear the seats. There are cabanas in the Turquoise pool area. The pool has a couple windows in the floor that view guests climbing down the stairs below. They have metal insulated Ziva cups available for purchase that are great for keeping drinks cool.",0

Had a fish taco cart come by, a fruit stand come by, someone cleaned our sunglasses, sprayed us with aloe, someone came and played saxaphone by us. Loved it so much we did it most days! Added bonus is if you have kids… ours takes an afternoon nap and we needed a comfy bed and shade. Then there’s a little pool shelf in front of each cabana so it’s like a private pool",0

358,Anani M,Jul 9,"For us it was. We had a jacuzzi on the balcony with amazing views. The room was cavernous and our butlers were awesome. We celebrated our anniversary and they made it really special with decorations, champagne, and surprises. Also the Turquoise exclusive pool is lovely and with fewer guests, the service was faster. Our stay was wonderful overall and I think we would have been happy in another building, but being able to relax in the balcony jacuzzi after all the pools were closed was heavenly. One other thing- you get a bottle of vodka, tequila, or another spirit in your room along with mixers in case you want a later night cocktail or a drink before the bars open. There is also an upgrade espresso machine.",0

366,Alesz94,Mar 2022,Yes so as both stated above me. The resort provides you with a free pcr test. Fast and easy. By appointment which they will help you with. Results in 72 hrs or less. I did pay extra to have the hotel pick me up at the airport and take me to the airport :) they are amazing and helpful ! :),0
367,F D,Nov 2021,"Cabana fee is a joke. They are empty for the most part. A few palapas by habeneros, they have the beach chairs with umbrellas, and after 6 they remove them off the beach.",0
367,David S,Oct 2021,Cabanas are $89 per day and it’s a money grab by Ziva. Very disrespectful to the guest that DON’T reserve a cabana.,0
367,Patricia R,Sep 2021,Bed cabanas around the pools are $89. It is the double decker cabanas that are $250. Those are only on the large beach side. . On the sand. The double deckers include your own private pool butler. Bottle of wine/ champagne. Also keep in mind that there are also environmental fees you will not see until you get your bill. But remember these are fees you will also get charged at any other resort. So you are probably safe adding another $25 ti the total. Prices might be lower depending on time of year you are there. We were there in July this time.,0

369,ystvan l,Sep 2021,Yes they always ask about allergies b 4 entering any restaurants and when you Chek in the hotel,1
369,Andrew E,Aug 2021,The only thing I do know about that is they ask you every time when you enter a restaurant to be seated if you have any food allergies. At the very least that means they are aware and want to accommodate.,1

On Thursday night a cold front came in and it rained all night and into the day Friday. The temp dropped to 77 degrees but the water in the pool was still warm. The kids swam in it after the rain stopped and so did I. The water felt warmer than the air. It's a beautiful resort if you have children and want to relax.

So just don’t skip out on your free test it’s quick and easy. My husband and I went end of September came back October 2nd, they just asked us to take the test 2 days prior of leaving.

I will say this: first time we went in the waves (they were pretty rough) two police looking guys came by and showed us a paper-I didn’t see it. I thought it was bc of rough water. Another couple at resort said they were told not to go in when entering country. We were not. The hotel staff didn’t tell us not to go to the beach either. By day 4 we, and 6 other people, were going in and playing undisturbed. Not that many people around. We walked to the right to far end and played in water no problem. You can walk on the rocks there and snorkel on the other side - there was a guard at the last 2 closed properties that told us we can walk around to snorkel, not through the property, but around by water’s edge. Hotel doesn’t give you any water toys. There was a snorkel you can buy in the little store they have on site. Hope this helps. We were there 6/25-7/1",1

The Marriott Cancun had their yearly convention of people from Tech Systems coming in and I had to get out and go to another propery for the last two days of my Cancun stay. I chose this Westin and I was thrilled! I booked a ocean view with balcony and was put into a HUGE suite for my remaining 2 days. I gave up my 1000 welcome points to get the buffet breakfast but I could have kept the points and been able to eat the Club room breakfast for free. Also there is a 4-6 happy hour with all kinds of drinks and hot and cols appetizers including desserts for free for Titanium Members. I loved the place so much that I returned in two weeks and I booked a lagoon room without a balcony. My upgrade was a Studio Room, Lagoon View with balcony. Studio rooms have full size refrigerators and a stove top, convection oven and plenty of cooking utensils. That worked out well for leftovers but I really hadn't planned on cooking.

This applies to ""all"" the resort credits. We didn't use any of them. The front line staff service is awesome (waiters, waitresses, etc.).

587,LindaT.,May 2022,"I’ll try to answer your questions. With Diamond you get use of a separate pool that was smaller and honestly looked boring. It’s basically a smaller pool that has its own seating area. I believe you get “better” drinks, you get a butler that makes reservations and does a few other things for you but most of the time you don’t need reservations as all the restaurants were available. My travel agent said to buy through her for a $1,000 U.S. but when we got there the receptionist cut us a deal for $600. We didn’t get it and quite honestly you don’t need it. They’re very flexible there so if you don’t get something in advance once you get there you can upgrade to whatever you want as long as it’s available. Do the massage and spa treatment, it’s amazing and the guy by the buffet entrance will get you a good deal. Facials are also really good so treat yourself it’s worth it. As for the cabana on the rooftop, it gets really hot so might be worth it but decide for yourself once you’re there. Have fun and stay safe!",0

You can visit the roof top bar even if not DC. Drinks are not free though. We visited for a brief look at the foam party, and toured the floor early one morning. Neat overlook, but we only stayed at the foam party a little while as it isn't a HUGE place, and there were a lot of people. Everyone has their own opinion on the DC. We felt it wasn't worth it. We received a pretty good deal through Apple Vac. and we do not need Top Shelf alcohol, although they have a very good variety of name brand liquors. We also did not need a butler to wait on us.

599,James and Kelci,Apr 2022,"You can negotiate the price for the Cabana on the 18th floor. A group of six of us payed $200 US for two bottles with our private butler. It is fairly cheap at 32.50 a person! The drinks are not premium but after drinking two bottles, you won't need the premium alcohol. I suggest to rent the Cabana when their is party going on...the pink party was wild! Highly recommend, and you get a private pool which is needed. The sun is very hot up there.",0

613,Corrina M,Apr 2022,"Hello 🙋, We stayed seven days at this resort and it was another one thousand dollars on top of what are room cost. My other half and I agree that the diamond club experience wasn't all that. Plus, that doesn't even include everything as far as certain restaurants and entrees. That was extra, so I would say save that thousand dollars and use it elsewhere. The entertainment was really corny and make sure you lock up your valuables. We don't know if it was our housekeeper, Butler, ect., Someone within their staff not only took about $250.00 American dollars out of our room when we were on the beach. But literally took several of my blouses. Their security is a joke and of course. No one would admit to stealing our money and clothes. The air is very damp, even with the air conditioner running. Have fun, but use caution",0
614,staceyht7,Mar 2022,"There is a light package to access the areas and have some benefits or a full package. It worked out an extra £500 on top of our holiday each for the diamond if we wanted to book at reception. For me and my friends this was expensive on top of the holiday price and we weren’t interested in what it had to offer. The drinks are exceptional , the top shelf did not interest us , everything was happening in the Royalton pool and we were able to walk into the restaurants every night without any reservation. The room service and front desk service was exceptional. We personally didn’t enjoy the roof top pool so wasn’t interested paying for drinks there when we had all inclusive on the others floors and all the entertainment was happening by the beach/ Royalton pool.",3

617,TMajic,Mar 2022,"Well, we were there last April. The signs said ""masks were required indoors"". We saw many that did not wear their masks indoors. The region is now ""green"" so the hotels can be 100% capacity, but masks are still required. As soon as we reached the doors to the outside areas we took our masks off.

624,Stephen C,Feb 2022,"Dos Equis, Presidente and some Coors Light. We had Coors Light in our mini-fridge. It tastes even worse than the other beers. I stuck with cocktails for this reason. In fact, Corona was a bit hard to find even off the resort. One important tip: bring your own bubba/insulated cups. The resort uses plastic cups for everything and they really, really, smell bad. They will spoil the taste of any drink you have.",1
625,Stephen C,Feb 2022,"Sorry about your stress. These are good questions. No need to book ahead for spa's, they are almost always empty due to the higher than Western prices for spa treatments at these places. The rapid test is free and onsite. The PCR test (required in Canada) is $90 US. Quarantine cost would be whatever the hotel's daily rates are as listed on their website. Did you go their website email address for customer service?

My husband is very easygoing and doesn't like people doing things for him, yet he LOVE Le Blanc. They have the magic touch as to how to make you feel like a queen yet not uncomfortable. As I stated, it's difficult to put into words. As far as the food goes, you can order pasta marinara and have it served your way. The French is more gourmet-oriented, but you shouldn't let that stop you, you should try it. The filet mignon there is AMAZING! I hope you chose Le Blanc, the beach, spa, and the staff are #1!",0

Typically there are no prices listed on the menus, those are all free. They may have add on items like expensive wines, or A1 Kobe beef upgrades, but those were a very select few items. Breakfast you can order room service or go to Blanc (buffet restaurant) in the AM. Our favorite reservation restaurant was Yama (Japanese) but Bella, Lumiere, and Blanc for dinner were all great too! Just make sure to get your reservations set when you get there so your able to enjoy each of the restaurants at least once. Also pro tip: you can order as many starters or entrees that you want. So you can try different foods while your there, plus portion sizes are on the smaller side. But that never bothered me since you can order two, or try two different things in the same sitting!",0

675,jaworld,Jul 2021,"Just returned from Villa Del Palmar, which is next door to Garza Blanca. We booked this because we traveled with our kiddos. We wanted to book Garza but read about construction issues and I'm glad we didn't. It was loud on that side. If you are looking for turquoise colored water, Garza Blanca doesn't have it. It's brown water filled with seaweed. It's 45 min north of Cancun and not near any shops. Isla Mujeres ferry is close but slow. Even the fast ferry is in Cancun Hotel Zone. We visited La Blanc but several years ago. Want to go back without kids. But might choose something else based on others reviews. Or go to Playa Del Carmen. We are seasoned travelers and expect luxury when paying for it. Let me know what you choose!",1
675,minnesotans4,Jul 2021,We thought the resort was beautiful but the food at most of the restaurants were subpar especially the French and Mexican restaurants. The hotel offered us incentives for upgraded rooms if we would return but we declined. Live Aqua has fabulous cuisine. We have been to quite a few all inclusive in Cancun and we would never go back to La Blanc. Live Aqua is our favorite. If you notice the reviewers who rave about La Blanc have 1 contribution.,1

My son and daughter-in-law went there for their honeymoon and loved it. Bring proof that you are on your honeymoon for extra treats.

741,Firefly103,Mar 2022,"Everywhere we have gone (including Secrets The Vine in December 2021) the Front Desk has been able to break pesos into smaller denominations. Depending on the time of day they might have more or less of them but you should not have a problem. I saw someone comment here earlier that ""they"" want to be tipped in US Dollars; we used to think that too but it is incorrect. When you tip them in US currency they have to go somewhere to exchange it (which forces them to take up their personal time) and they also lose some of the value of that currency when they exchange it. If they go and try to spend a US Dollar at a local grocery store it is a hassle and they will definitely lose money on that exchange. Unless a currency is in total collapse, locals will always prefer their local currency to a foreign one. Yes, if you ask them they are going to say ""it's OK"" or ""No Problem"" if you tip them in US Dollars but that is because they are grateful for getting any tip and it is in their nature and what they are taught at the resorts, which is to never let anything be a ""hassle"" for the guests. There is also the problem that tourists often don't understand the actual value of the foreign currency and since a peso is less than a dollar they tend to err on the wrong side and tip less than they might mean to. This is another reason that an employee or other local is willing to take the hit on losing money on a conversion of foreign currency. The bottom line is that 99.9% of the time you are going to be the one in a more favorable financial situation than the individual you are tipping so do them a favor and make it the best financial outcome for them by understanding the conversion rate and tipping them in their local currency.",1

758,Firefly103,Jan 2022,"The entire staff wears masks in all situations. They are constantly wiping things down (this is just for show IMHO since contact transmission of the virus is virtually unheard of). They have Social Distancing notifications up all over. The elevators are the issue and this is a high-rise so you are going to be on the elevators multiple times every day. They strongly encourage you to wear your masks in the elevator and that is honestly the highest risk place since you are in close proximity with minimal air exchanges, albeit for relatively short periods of time. During our check in they said (I'm paraphrasing here) ""we prefer you mask up indoors but if you don't could you at least just wear a mask on the elevators"". You could ask these people to mask up if they get on with you but they typically are not even carrying masks with them and frankly, asking a boozed-up anti-masker to mask up on a vacation where one of the main attractions for them is the perceived lack of restrictions, is probably not a great idea. You can get off or not get on if there are unmasked people but then you might never get to your floor. There were not a lot of these individuals when we were there but we were on the elevator at least once a day with people who did not mask up.",1

Please read carefully not only my report about the hotel itself, my other texts about attractions in Cancún and also what others say about the area and destination, to confirm it's not a wise decision to go there as a family! It's much richer, safer, funnier and better to go to Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta or even Acapulco but by no means Cancún, aimed at a young crowd seeking sex, drugs, loud music and more...

832,DLopatkin,Feb 2022,"Taxis are safe, you can book your transfer safely (and much cheaper) with Happy Shuttle Cancun (google it) - we use it here everywhere, unfortunately no app, only Web. Beach chairs are free for guests, no need reservation. Near a lot of local shops, restaurants, big supermarket with lots of fruits and alcohol (if you like it), and 30 mins by foot or 5 mins on the taxi there is a huge La Isla Shopping Village - from local brands to Gicci and LV))) That's why I consider location of this hotel is the best!",1 vote

835,Ramon Q,Jan 2022,"During our trip I saw the staff attach a basketball net to the pool and on another day a volleyball net through one side of the pool allowing a game of volleyball. Now the pool is about 4-5 feet in this section I believe so playing would be made easy. During our trip the deep section of the pool was under construction however I can say they were working on it quickly so hopefully it's open by May. For the nighttime entertainment question: yes they do, one night in the main lobby they had a live performance of bachata themed music and on another night they had a asada night which consisted of a buffet of different types of meats sponsored by live music. One thing I would suggest is to ask about upcoming events they have during your stay because we didn't find out about these events until we stumbled upon them which we would have liked to be informed to plan accordingly.",0
837,Rolando J,Jan 2022,I’m not sure about the gym but the pools were open and yes they provide towels at or near pool,0
838,Van Moloney,Dec 2021,We purchased our all inclusive upon arrival. I would recommend maybe calling before traveling and asking prices and when you arrive you will be able to purchase.,0

840,keaheymatthew,Nov 2021,"Yes. Food and drink and minibar is included with the all-inclusive. There are also some premium choices available at some dinners that have a small upcharge. We've traveled here annually for 26 years. Best staff, beach, and views in Cancun.",0

It took about 12 hours for the hotel doctor to email me the results. If you want more tests, there are mobile testing sites all over the place.

857,ELI5Indiana,Sep 2020,"We have been to Krystal 4 times (pre-covid) (going back at end of September 2020) I will try to remember to post an update after our trip. Anyway, in the past there are 6 places to choose to eat. I don't remember their exact names but here is a description of them: (Included with All-Inclusive = AI) 1. Main Dining Room: AI- This is a relaxed dining room that puts a different spread out each day for B/L/D. Swim suit with cover up, shorts, t-shirts,flip flops appropriate. 2. Tiki Hut: AI - This is outside at the far end of the pool. Seating is outdoors, overlooks the beach. Order at the hut, eat at your pool chair or at the hut. Hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken fingers, etc. 3. Italian Restaurant: AI- You need reservations here. It is a small dining room that serves an Italian fare. Dressy- casual. If the evening is cool they will open the sliding glass doors and you can hear the ocean. Nice wine selection, food is ok. 4. Sushi Bar: AI - in the main lobby, on the end of the Lobby Bar, there is a little sushi counter. The sushi is fresh and made to order. It is delicious! We've gotten to know the sushi chef and he makes us new treats and combos to try. Great place to snack between lunch and dinner when swimming all day! 5. Private Steakhouse - This steakhouse is on the property. It is not included in AI. It looks amazing, but we have never been to it. I'm sure you would need reservations. 6. El Mortero - Partial AI - This is a Mexican restaurant that is off property, but a quick walk within a few minutes. Reservations needed. The menu is mostly included in AI, but not all of it. The margaritas are very good. Mariachi bank plays at 7 pm. Dressy/casual. I hope this helps!",1

868,Timmy T,May 2019,"The hotel has a special Pagoda that accommodates romantic dinners for guests. The area was directly below our room, we saw two occasions where they set up a table and served romantic dinners, candles, champagne, and wait staff for the table. It offered a beautiful ocean front view with the sound of waves and a gorgeous sunset. The Concierge at the entrance of the hotel was also very helpful with making recommendations as well.",1
869,tathianna,Apr 2019,"No, it’s 25$ American money which is 500 pesos. It’s not hourly it’s daily and they bring you drinks and food.",1
870,Jimmy Super,Mar 2019,Spring Break is probably the worse time to go. The location of the Krystal Hotel is close to some of the biggest night clubs. Look at the reviews where some families just returned from there stay at the Krystal. Not good. March is not the time to go to Mexico. Talk to your travel agent. The Krystal is beautiful and the beach and ocean. February is the best time. Drunk college kids everywhere and noisy in the hotel. You will not get sleep and it will be a waist of your money.,0
871,Alison,Apr 2019,There are other restaurants in the area within walking distance if you don’t want a big breakfast.,0
872,PRSMinnesota,Oct 2019,Yes they will hold luggage for you,0
873,PRSMinnesota,Oct 2019,We stayed in the old tower. There are multiple restaurants but it is definitely worth verifying with the hotel which are included and which are not.,0
873,Jimmy Super,Mar 2019,"Kristine, I recommend to stay away from all inclusive it’s part of your vacation package. The reps will take you into time share which will take up a lot of your time. They are relentless. I’ve been to the Krystal several times. Tower B is great the view is spectacular. All inclusive is cheaper but your better off paying for your flight separate and just go to the restaurants on your own time. No pressure. The sushi bar at the Hotel is great plus there is a Mexican restaurant next to the Krystal it’s beautiful. The beach is awesome. Time share people will try and sell you on time share do not do it. Talk to your travel agent and see if they can arrange your flight and room. The location is great. Have fun.",0
873,Shahrokh B,Feb 2019,there are plenty restaurants around,0
873,Jennifer P,Feb 2019,"There are two restaurants, one snack bar, a coffee bar, a sushi bar, and an outdoor buffet (for dinner). The food is horrible and not everything on the menu is part of the all inclusive package.",0
873,Robert B,Feb 2019,Sorry it took so long. We stayed in the old tower. There were 2 restaurants that we frequented on site plus the Starbucks in the rear lobby. Good restaurants within walking distance.,0
873,Rezboy,Feb 2019,"Tower C is the oldest. I have been in it since 1995. I think you are referring to tower B, which is in the middle. There should be multiple restaurants but there are so many places to eat and things to do that I never have purchashed the all inclusive except in the Riviera Maya Hard Rock because you have no other options there.",0
873,Jill S,Feb 2019,"Honestly, I'm not sure if we were in the new tower or not...(sorry). The buffet is there, of course, and there is an Italian restaurant as well - it was very delicious! For more casual dining, there is a fish hut for ordering lunch out closer to the pool. There is a Mexican restaurant available, but note you do have to leave the premises and walk a short distance to get to it. We loved the Mexican place, and went there a couple of times with our family! Have a great time!",0

873,lamosteve,Feb 2019,I stayed in the older tower and it was ok. I went on the European plan as I didnt want to be limited food option wise and my gf is a super picky eater. There are 2 -3 restaurants on site and the choice of food seemed adequate. Hope this helps.,0

875,lamosteve,Jan 2019,"the beach is lovely, you can wade out over 100 yards and you will still be in 3 feet of water. the water is around 75F. around noon, locals selling fruit and necklaces will be on the beach, so to avoid that, stay on the concrete side of the property. The swimming pools are cold. I went on the european plan. VIPS across the street is good for breakfast and the lunch options at the palapa bar at the hotel are good, make sure Linda is your server. Several dinner options nearby. Steve",1
875,lamosteve,Jan 2019,"Hello. I took a shuttle called Amstar. Its 19.00 USD per person round trip. The drivers wear blue hawaiian type shirts. Very friendly and good service. The only hitch is making sure you get your return shuttle confirmed the day after you arrive, or else you will be biting your nails and wondering ( they did confirm via email). Also if you go out for dinner, make sure to look for the propina ( tip) as many restaurants add in into your total ( we double tipped twice , oops). Steve",1
875,Christine Barnes,Jan 2019,"Yes there is a grocery store right across the road and a mall about 2 mins to your left it has Hard Rock Cafe chilies some nice stores. Safe walking through the day time wouldn’t do walking at night. There is a lovely Mexican outlet next to the grocery store nice handmade things. Take a reputable taxi company from the hotel, I went all inclusive so I was provided this in my package. Anything further I would be glad to answer have done extensive travel.",1
875,Jenny,Jan 2019,"Hi there, as two female travelers ourselves, my friend and I booked a shuttle online called canada transfers. They were very safe and reliable so have a look on their website. (Even though it’s called Canada transfers it’s actually in mexico lol). And yes the grocery store is huge! Everything that you possibly need is available and it’s less than a 5 minute stroll to the store. It’s very safe and as two 20 year olds travelling on our own, we did not feel unsafe at any time during our stay at Krystal Cancun or the amenities nearby. Have an amazing time with your daughter, it’s going to be a trip of a lifetime :)",1
875,Jimmy Super,Mar 2019,"There are shuttles at the airport but don’t let them sell you on taking a cab. It’s too much money. Also honestly it’s your daughters graduation just eat at the hotel. I’m sure the food is excellent plus the restaurant,s are great. El Montero ,Hard Rock Cafe is fun plus live entertainment at 10:00pm. Going to the stores is not worth it. If your trying to save money maybe but your on vacation just spend your money at the hotel by the pool and beach.",0
875,Darren H,Feb 2019,"Walmart is merely a 5 minute walk, fully loaded",0
875,Rezboy,Feb 2019,Everything in the area is safe. It is the hotel zone and is a strip so you cant get lost and next to no crime. I have been ripped off once there since 1995. A taxi told me the Surfin Burrito was 2 miles and $8 to get there. He drove up the strip 1 mile and turned around at the first place available and drove back one mile. He didnt lie but it was just across the street from where we started.,0

1021,CanadaClayton,Jun 2021,"Hello lisa, The hotel has wonderful views of the sea. The best rooms are the master suites with 180 ° view and plunge pool, but there are preferred club ocean view rooms with the plunge pool. The beach is super beautiful and has inflatables, there are also many activities to do and a water taxi to go shopping. the service is the best all very friendly and very helpful, it is worth going to Dreams Vista. Cheer up!",1
1021,LindaS,Jun 2021,Thank you both for your responses.,0
1021,deny0214,Jun 2021,"Hi Lisa, honestly if you’re very far from the ocean the view won’t be that awesome, but all rooms do get to experience a view. It’s just that some have it close and other farther. Now, you are either in the pool or the beach but I honestly don’t recommend the beach. Nothing around to walk to from the resort. There is a Cancún Mall the hotel told us about. Your supposed to arrange a water taxi to take you but when we had scheduled it, the sea was kinda rough and they weren’t able to take us but it looks nice. We passed by while heading to a restaurant. Not gonna lie, the roof top looks awesome but it’s always packed. Not a lot of space and it is small. Hope this helps.",0

Nizuc it’s a beautiful hotel , if you go there , stay at the villas , they are close to the main building and some of them have their own private pool and garden . It’s something very different from the rest of hotels in Cancún, not a “all inclusive “ and more quiet also . It’s 5 minutes from the airport and the hotel provides transfer , which I strongly recommend because at the airport it’s terrible, they abuse from the people who doesn’t have transfer and it’s very overpriced !",0

I would ask the management about alcohol, as that did not occur to me to bring our own. They have an extensive, multi-national wine list to choose from, and all the top brands you could think of in terms of hard liquor. Hope you love it as much as we did at Nizuc!",1
1058,Daniel B,Mar 2019,"The hotel has a stated policy against bringing outside alcohol in.

1062,itsjustjeremyy,Dec 2018,"I have not been in March, but I can’t imagine spring breakers spending their time nor money at this fabulous resort. It’s very chic and is located at the southern end of the Cancun strip. It is very remote from the chaotic scene most spring breakers come to enjoy. Spring breakers tend to stay at “all inclusive” resorts with meals and alcohol included, that are closer to the nightlife. Nizuc is luxurious with amazing food, service and amenities. The dinner menus are well thought out at each restaurant and the bars at the hotel offer relaxing vibes. I am certain you and your parents will enjoy Nizuc at any time of the year! P.S. I recommend enjoying their spa facilities. I’ve never experienced anything like it before nor after. You won’t be disappointed.",0

1064,Juan Diez Canedo Jaime,Nov 2018,For the long walks the answer not so much. There are two properties in this private beach and it must have around 1 km of beach or a little less. There are restaurants in the hotel (expensive) you can't walk to nearby bars and restaurants it has to be done by taxi. It is the very fist hotel int the Cancun Hotel strip if you are coming from the airport. To get to down town Cancun it could take you around 30 minutes by taxi,0

1081,Mobile561083,May 2022,They have water dispensers all over he resort. They even provide reusable bottles in the rooms. The water is safe to drink right out of your tap or you can use the dispense. Every bar and restaurant has water for you. Drink up!! Oh and ice too!!!,0
1081,archna92,May 2022,"Honestly I didn’t see any options to purchase bottled water. They offer “bottled” water that’s filled by the fountain in glass bottles. But it doesn’t taste good. The only places we personally drank water that was provided that tasted “normal” was at the buffet, and the bar close to the buffet, and the bar closest to the beach.",0
1081,andodad,May 2022,Iberostar is so environmentally conscious that they do not have bottled water on site. That said they offer refillable water bottles and chilled and filtered water dispensers on each floor. This is standard at iberostar resorts. Wa are water snobs and have NO issue with the quality of the water and consider this a strength of their resorts. The bottles go in the fridge and are very nice glass bottles.,0
1081,nicolestoc,May 2022,They don’t sell bottled water at the hotel but I drank their water from the water machine which is on each floor in the hotel and at the restaurants and buffet. I had no issues. I wouldn’t drink it from the tap in your room. That being said you can buy water from the stores but it can be quite pricey. I hope this helps.,0
1081,Faith B,May 2022,"They sell bottled water in the boutique store in the property, and from convenient store just 15mins walk away from the hotel.

1081,Sarah A,May 2022,"I'm not aware that you can buy any water bottles on the property. But there is a supermarket (The Royal Market) about a 15 minute walk North of the hotel, or you can take the bus (4 minute ride). There is a bus stop right outside the hotel, the R1 and R2 buses come every 5 minutes if not less. It's a $1 to ride each way and very easy to use (you do not need to convert to MX pesos, you can pay with USD). They do have an app for their bus system called Moovit, it's useful to have if you're not sure which bus to take and what bus stop to be at.",0

Side view balconies probably can get away with it (where we were in previous visit). Want to see what going in? Ask for pool side balcony (what we should have done). More expensive but worth it to us in the future. Smoking (all kinds) in the beach area seem to be okay. Hope this helps.,0

Do not lose the key because there is only one. The safe is already located in your room. Preparing to leave, you want to have your rapid covid test done within 24hours of traveling. Originally they told me $54/person but when I got there they offered it complimentary. I believe it’s whatever is included in your package. They give you a paper to fill out prior to testing, mark complimentary and if they say it’s not included then they will ask you to pay separate. Truthfully, the person doing the testing doesn’t even check. They see complimentary and do it for free… that was my experience anyways. The restaurants for the most part are casual dress meaning no bathing suits/covers or swim trunks and a T-shirt. You can wear shorts and a T-shirt and flip flops. Some dining included with the pyramid is more formal meaning dress/skirt/khakis/ polo shirt/ dress sandal. Hope this helps:)",0

There is a special restaurant that I recommend for breakfast and lunch, no dress code. The regular buffet sucks!!! You got to eat at the Japanese restaurant. OMG it was awesome.

I suggest springing for the Pyramid if you are a foodie since this gives you access to the best restaurants, including the 5 star rated restaurant in the actual Pyramid.

If you, however, alter your accommodation status to a double room and register the visitor as a guest, paying the difference, the hotel cannot forbid anything, for the person is then a paying guest, being paid or not to be in that position. There are 'rooms by the hour' in Cancún for such encounters, one just have to look. Wise choices, Vítor",0

As a matter of fact, neither is the hotel aimed at families with children nor Cancún itself, so I honestly advise you to choose a different destination in Mexico and/or a different hotel! Please read carefully not only my report about the hotel itself, my other texts about attractions in Cancún and also what others say about the area and destination, to confirm it's not a wise decision to go there as a family! It's much richer, safer, funnier and better to go to Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta or even Acapulco but by no means Cancún, aimed at a young crowd seeking sex, drugs, loud music and more...

Great location (very romantic), great food and exceptional service, and quiet, which is more than you can say about several restaurants in the more central parts of the Zona. A bit hard to find, you need to walk through the reception of a small hotel, but definitely worth the effort.

Also on the way to the exit there are dozens (literally) of people in tan pants and white shirts who appear to be tourist helpers. They really want to send you to a particular hotel or a time share presentation etc. If you see them just continue straight ahead and when you exit you will see angled parking for shuttle vans. Marriott comes to one of the closest ones so just watch. Even if you are in the other exit corridor it is ok. Just continue to the exit and a little way to the right you will come to the van area. Do stop at a change place for a few pesos since there will be lots of services to tip. The hotel takes credit cards. It is a very short ride to the hotel. Serge",1
1571,heyjudithz,Jun 2016,"Here's what I would do. Find a cab driver, there are a zillion. Ask him to make a call for you and hold up a $5 bill. It will be well worth it. Tip: Call the 800 number first from home, and get the actual number to call for the shuttle; then you will have it ready. If a cab driver is not available, there are many people who would be glad to do this for $5. the shuttle is FREE to the hotel. The guy on the phone will tell you exactly where to go to pick it up, as there are several terminals at the Cancun airport.

Its not just a drink you are paying for but, the luxury of the RC as well. Each drink we had was phenonmenal, the food was fantastic and the service was impecable. I got us a high end massage, that was about $500 us, we rented a casita on the beach which was $160us. Both of those items we could have done over and over, the experience you so great.
