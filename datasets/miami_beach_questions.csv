Jan 7th before we head home to Alberta. We've never seen Miami before, so we would like to hang around for 2 days/nights. Our friend was there last year and she said to stay away from South Beach hotels 'cause in the evenings she said it gets very noisy and can get a little too wild with a party scene for those in their 20's. We are in our mid 50's. However, we did love staying on the main strip of Waikiki Beach last year (we loved the family friendly street entertainment). She said it's not the same thing as South Beach. So my question is, what is the noise level/party scene like in the evenings from this hotel? We noticed the hotel offers entertainment which sounds great but what type of entertainment is it? 2) Does the hotel offer lounge chairs and beach towels at the beach? Is there a fee to use it? 3) How often does the airport shuttle run? I understand it is included in the hotel stay, correct? Thanks for any help you can offer :) Denise"

I was told that it was NOT free, that it was $40 something, and it had never been free. What the heck? She also said the public parking lot close by charges $1 an hour.

When reading about 50 of the reviews all of the Managers responses were the same. Why is that?? The response I received everyone else who gave them a bad or not so great review received the same response. The guest that gave them a good or great review (I don't know why) received the same response. So who gives these responses? Does anyone even take time to read them and see how to improve their Hotel, their staff? With the MONEY they charge you, you would think they would. I'm not understanding that. Please if someone could answer this question for me it would be highly appreciated."

This question was answer by a hotel representatives named “ itatse” which answer was that you guys do have some room that have a sofa bed but they not advertised online to reserve you need to reach directly the hotel. So after seeing the question and answer I call the hotel directly to reserve. Which was False advertisement, I called the hotel to request the sofa bed since I booked a double bed room for four people. A man picked up the phone and transferred me after I explained my solution to him. When I was transferred another lady picked up the phone and also transferred my called to reservation. Finally I explained my solution and requested the sofa bed. The lady I was speaking to which unfortunately didn’t have the chance to get her name was beyond rude. I kindly explained to her how I read on TripAdvisor you guys do offer sofa bed. She told me no we only offer two bed room and one bed with a nasty tone. I took her again I was just calling to confirm since most hotels do have sofa beds or roll away beds to accommodate their guests. Her response was well not at this hotel. After this call I regret making reservations at this hotel. I hope I have a better and more welcoming experiences upon arrival."

My travel buddy and I are both petite girls, so I was thinking a King would be fine if we couldn't change to double queens, but I'm now worried after seeing ""Parlor Room."" After Googling the room and the term for that matter I'm not so sure this will work or be a favorable image for two ladies to be staying in. I also didn't see an option for a two bed room on the website, so I didn't know if that was possible either. My real questions are as follows: 1. Will there be enough space for two women that are quite close, but not couples so to speak? 2. Is there a 2 bed option? 3. Are all rooms to dim for make-up even in the bathroom? 4. Is the parlor room some ""private"" room that's not normally used for travelers?"

And they only stayed for two hours, because after a two hour nap, my son had over 50 bites all over the top part of his body (and I've just spent last few hours watching him still itch, a full week later). The conundrum is because the hotel behaved excellently and moved them to their sister hotel within literally minutes, and looked after them very well at the second hotel. I understand from someone else's post a month ago that they had a similar, though apparently less well resolved, situation...I also just read of a couple celebrating their anniversary with the same problem.

3735,Beacon South Beach Hotel,Adrienne E,"Pickerington, Ohio",May 2018,37,8,"Hi my question is for The Beacon: how common is it for the management answering reviews on trip advisor to lie? I wrote that the rooms were not big enough for 4 people and you wrote that’s because we had more then 4 in a room. That is a lie. We had 4 people in our room,2 guys myself and my sister...that’s 4. It was too small. Our second room had 4 girls that’s all. One of the days a friend came to go out with us but she did not stay the night. So don’t try and discount my review because your salty I gave you a 1. It’s your own fault. Look at the pics we took of the bad condition, you can’t argue those and you did not even address it in your response. And we knew checkin was at 3pm all we wanted to do was store our bags, we had the person on reservation call to verify herself and verify us. And at first all she got was a smart remark and no’s. Which was very frustrating. You need to learn to admit when your wrong and resolve the situation in a better way rather then trying to place blame on your customers when all we wanted to do is enjoy our time."

I expected this to have a full view of the ocean but in later speaking with the hotel via phone I found out this is not the case. I intended to book a full ocean view but on their website the full ocean front view is actually listed as ""pool view"", which is why I did not book that. Very deceiving.

6411,"MB Hotel, Trademark Collection by Wyndham",Mauricio M,,Feb 2018,10,1,"To whom it may concern: I understand NOW that the hotel was under construction. Sincerely it's not my concern that you work or don't work with Priceline. The issue is that I booked through Priceline and if your hotel is going to be advertised there, you SHOULD have control of what they list on their website. This was NOT obviously overlooked by us as mentioned on the email. If we would have known, and if the renovation was clear as when booking the night, NOT on the fine print as you say it was mentioned once the reservation is done, it would have been a different story. We DID NOT decide to stay in the hotel for another night, we were obligated to stay; when we asked to be transferred, Priceline said that the hotel had already charged our second night, and that you wouldn't reimburse the second night. We refused to pay another night at a different hotel when the one was already charged. Later we find out when checking out that the second night hadn't been charged, in fact, we had to pay for it right then and there. Every single time we book through Priceline, we pay in advance (and we paid in advance). At this point, we don't understand why we were charged for the other night when checking out. I don't believe you are transparent about your renovations. If you where, this would be advertised AS YOU MAKE THE RESERVATION, not after the reservation has been confirmed and under the fine print (per your responses)"

6835,Hilton Bentley Miami/South Beach,mbeaton20,"Miami Beach, Florida",Mar 2015,1,,"Hilton is one of the most recognized names in the industry and we are proud that the global traveler has been saying ""Take Me to Hilton"" for over a century. The Hilton Bentley Miami/South Beach is beachfront on one of the most famous streets, Ocean Drive. We are in the ""heart"" of South Beach and steps away from the best restaurants and clubs this City has to offer. It is perfectly situated for the Guest to experience the many amazing activities that are unique to the beach area. We want our Guests to feel welcomed and well served no matter what type of getaway they are seeking. During your recent stay, we had the unfortunate circumstance of having to operate the hotel on a manual back-up system as our electronic computerized operating system was down and we had no estimated time when normal operations would resume. We had a full roster of arrivals and we're not able to accommodate your room change request at that moment due to the unusual operating circumstances of the hotel. I did my very best to explain the situation and let you know that my priority was the Guest experience and did not want to make any promises that I could not keep and would make every effort to remedy the situation asking for patience as we sorted out the arrivals. I did everything within my means and wrote you a personal note at the end of the day, still operating without a system, to apologize that we had not been able to accommodate the room change. I strive to make each Guest feel special and that their stay is a memorable experience. Hilton is a global leader in hospitality trying to share the best of us with the best of you. We had an isolated incident and regret any inconvenience. We hope to have a future opportunity to welcome you and give you our special Hilton Bentley Miami/South Beach hospitality. Safe travels and hope to see you soon. Best regards, Michelle Beaton"

Estou tentando cancelar a reserva mas o telefone não atende e o hotel tão pouco responde e-mails. Eu paguei um depósito de segurança com direito s reembolso. Muito difícil de entrar em contato com este hotel. Eu acredito que seria importante o Trip Advisor fazer esta colocação. Me baseie nas avaliações para fazer a reserva.
